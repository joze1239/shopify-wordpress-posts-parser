            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meditation is a long-honored practice of breathing deeply and quieting the mind. Meditation for sleep can be done through mindfulness visualizations, guided prompts, or simply by sitting comfortably free of distractions. It’s a practice used by many to alleviate stress, calm anxiety, and improve the quality of sleep. Since it’s a quiet activity meant to relax both the mind and body, it’s the perfect way to prepare for a good night’s sleep.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By limiting the level of stimulation in the brain and centering the mind on one calming mantra or intention, it allows the mind to slow down and drift off to sleep more easily. For those who have difficulty battling insomnia, practicing meditation is one method that may be helpful. It’s accessible to anyone and doesn’t require a lot of time to have a big impact in decreasing sleep problems.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To begin, sit comfortably with your legs crossed and palms up in a room free of noise and distraction. Start to slow your breath and pay attention to your inhales and exhales. Many like to use the three-second breathing method: Inhale for three seconds, hold it for three seconds, and exhale for three seconds. Continue this rhythm until it becomes natural and you can continue the breathing exercises without counting. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you practice meditation, close your eyes and allow your thoughts to flow through freely. Rather than clearing the mind completely, avoid holding onto any single thought. Another option is to follow a sound or guided meditation on sleep available through various apps. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meditation and sleep best practices help to relieve stress, calm your mind, and allow you to truly tune into what your mind and body needs. Taking a few moments every night can put you in a peaceful state of mind and let your body know that it’s time to relax.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incorporating Meditation Into a Healthy Sleep Routine</span></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep deprivation occurs for several reasons: lifestyle changes, insomnia, sleep apnea, illness, and a range of other challenges. The effects of sleep deprivation on the brain make it difficult for many to achieve a solid eight hours of sleep per night. Social media and smartphones also affect how much sleep we get each night. Whether it’s the alert of notifications, the screen’s glow, or anticipation and anxiety that continues to stimulate the mind even after we look away from the screen, it makes it harder to wind down and achieve good sleep. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help remedy sleep deprivation, it’s important to find a sleep routine that works for you. Meditation is a valuable addition to any healthy sleep habits. Other ways to fall asleep faster include: </span></p>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exercising in the evening</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoiding late afternoon naps</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lowering the temperature in your bedroom </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Limiting the amount of caffeine consumed throughout the day</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Removing electronics from the room </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being mindful of what you eat before bed</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting a new pillow or mattress</span></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each of these tips promote a healthier sleep routine that when followed can help you get quality, consistent sleep. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exercising in the Evening</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining a regular exercise routine is beneficial to your health and some find it more effective in the evening as a way to wind down. By engaging in physical activity a few hours before your regular bedtime, it raises your body temperature, much like a warm bath or shower might do. Afterward, you get to experience the cooldown period, which prepares you for better sleep. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not recommended to participate in high-intensity exercise right before bed, but a long walk, lifting weights, or yoga are all good ways to workout without overstimulating the body and mind too much. Each of these restorative activities pair nicely with meditation for sleep and can be performed at the same time.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoiding Late Afternoon Naps</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on your typical sleep cycle, naps may be a trick to get you on a regular sleep routine. However, be wary of taking naps too late in the day for too long. This can throw off your body’s natural rhythm and keep you awake far past your normal bedtime. Exactly how long should you nap for? If it helps to rest during the day, set a timer for 20 or 30 minutes to take a quick nap. Even if you're unable to fully achieve falling asleep, it’s also a good time to meditate for a few moments and be still.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people may need extra time to feel refreshed, while others feel groggy if they nap for too long. Listen to your body and sleep when necessary during the day. If you find yourself sleeping long stretches during the day but inconsistently at night, it’s likely that your circadian rhythm is off and needs to be recalibrated.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lowering the Temperature in Your Bedroom</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most common reasons people have difficulty falling or staying asleep is because their room is too warm. When the thermostat isn’t at your ideal sleeping temperature, it can be difficult to doze off or meditate. When the temperature is at one end of the extremes, your body won’t be able to fully relax. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turn down the thermostat a few degrees. If you don’t have the air-conditioning system on, open the windows or run a fan to prompt air circulation throughout the room and provide enough ventilation. During the winter, still keep the thermostat set lower and layer your bedding rather than having one heavy blanket to cover the bed. With the </span><a href=\"https://www.eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight Sleep Pod</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you will have the ability to personalize your bed temperature to regulate the perfect temperature. Simple changes like these can do wonders for how much and how well you sleep at night.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Limiting the Amount of Caffeine Throughout the Day</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone responds to caffeine consumption differently. Some can make it through the day with one cup of coffee in the morning, while others stock up on caffeinated drinks all day long. If you’re used to drinking a high amount of caffeine, slowly reduce the amount you consume every day. Or, strive for a “cutoff” point and see if it affects your sleep for the better.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, an afternoon coffee or tea might be manageable, if it’s not after 3 PM. Test different times and amounts of caffeine to determine the right amount for you. A better option is to swap your daily pick-me-up with a walk around the block, stretching, or added hydration. You may be surprised how well these work in place of your favorite caffeinated beverages.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Removing Electronics from the Room </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the digital age, we look at our smartphones multiple times a day. It’s not uncommon to also read articles, scroll through social media, or watch videos all the way up to when it’s time for bed. While it can feel restful in the moment, the constant online activity and light from the screen can trigger the brain to stay alert and awake. As a result, it takes longer to settle into sleep. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try limiting how much you look at screens in the evening. When finished using, power them down and leave them in another room at least an hour before bed. Take advantage of any additional time to read a book or magazine, meditate, or another quiet activity that doesn’t require interaction or too much engagement.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being Mindful of What You Eat Before Bed</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spicy or acidic foods are known to disrupt sleep because of the effects they have on the body, especially when eaten late in the evening. These types of foods can cause an upset stomach, acid reflux, or heartburn, all of which can cause discomfort and keep you up at night. When these symptoms become a reason you can’t sleep, cut back on what you eat right before bed. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Milder foods like bananas or oatmeal are the kinds of snacks that can help cure the midnight munchies and also, promote fitful sleep. You can also reference 10 foods to eat before bed to help you sleep better. When you focus your attention to what’s triggering certain events or limitations to your sleep, you can start changing your dietary and other lifestyle habits for the better.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting a New Pillow or Mattress</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re not sleeping well and nothing else seems to be working, it may be as simple as swapping out your pillow or mattress. Waking up with a stiff neck is never fun and can be a result of a pillow that’s lost its fluff. Also, if your pillow isn’t in good condition, you may end up tossing and turning throughout the night. The same goes for the support of your mattress.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do a pillow test and find what level of firmness you like best and switch out the old with something new. Typically, you should buy new pillows every one to two years and a new mattress every ten. By updating your bedding, it provides a comfortable place to rest without shifting sleeping positions all night to find the one that works well. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being Mindful about Sleep</span></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meditation before sleep benefits include being present in the moment and checking in with how you feel physically and mentally. By creating a healthy sleep routine, you are proactively changing your environment and habits to get better sleep. It doesn’t require adding every method into your own sleep routine. Pick and choose the parts that work best for you and leave the rest.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whenever your mind starts to wander and you just can’t fall asleep, meditation helps as a tool to get you back to a relaxed state. Once you’ve developed healthy sleep habits, including meditation, your sleep should soon begin to improve.  </span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regular exercise works hand-in-hand with getting a good night’s sleep as ways to maintain optimal health. The question has always been is it better to work out in the morning or at night? There are several advantages to working out before sleep, but every person is different. Try different times of day to find what works best for you. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, take into account: what are your sleep habits?</span><a href=\"https://site.eightsleep.com/blogs/news/are-you-a-hot-sleeper\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Are you a hot sleeper</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? See if that’s what’s keeping you up at night or if it’s the exercise itself. Benefits of working out before sleep include: </span></p>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raises body temperature followed by a post-workout cooldown phase</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alleviates stress and tension</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Establishes a routine that promotes consistency for your circadian rhythm</span></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Establish what your current sleep patterns are and how working out may improve how well you sleep. Reference our article, What is a Normal Sleeping Pattern for further information. Each of these benefits can lead to a consistent sleep schedule and more quality rest per night. By exploring each benefit more fully, you’ll determine what’s likely to be a successful first step for you. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raises Body Temperature</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working out increases the heart rate, gets the blood pumping, and raises your body temperature. While this may not sound ideal for a good night’s rest, by giving yourself enough time between working and going to sleep, it heats up the body (similar to a warm bath or shower) and then, rewards your workout with a cool down period. Your body temperature weighs heavily on how well you’ll sleep through the night. It naturally lowers when it’s time to sleep. To ensure you’re sleeping at your optimal sleeping temperature, smart beds like the </span><a href=\"https://www.eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight Sleep Pod</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can regulate your bed to your </span><a href=\"https://site.eightsleep.com/blogs/news/ideal-bed-temperature\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ideal sleeping temperature.</span></a></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea of “working out, can’t sleep” isn’t necessarily true. There are studies that show working out before bed doesn’t alter the amount or quality of your sleep. However, vigorous activity right before bed may keep you alert for longer. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plan your workouts accordingly. Avoid working out a few hours before your regular bedtime to give the body enough time to adjust and transition from activity to a resting state. This could mean a high-intensity workout in the morning and a gentle yoga practice or an after-dinner walk in the evening. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alleviates Stress and Tension</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another positive effect of working out is how it alleviates stress. This is especially helpful before going to sleep if you’re challenged by quieting the mind or feeling antsy as you try to drift off to sleep. Exercise helps to reduce tension and puts you in a relaxed state of being and promotes sleep. Additionally, a post-workout stretch or time spent in a steam room or jacuzzi following a workout can alleviate muscle soreness and provide an overall sense of relaxation the body needs to prepare for sleep.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many, a workout in the evening is a relaxing transition from the hectic pace of work and commuting to a time where you get to focus on yourself. Exercising for your health isn’t a new concept. Although, studies still find most Americans spend more time participating in sedentary activities like going online or watching TV rather than allotting 20 or 30 minutes for exercise. In fact, some even skip workouts due to stress rather than a way to combat it. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding in regular workouts throughout the week is one of the most effective stress management techniques people can try, which in turn, helps to maintain consistent sleep patterns.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Establishes a Routine</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improving sleep habits comes down to finding a routine that works for you. Consistency balances your circadian rhythm and gives you body signals of when it’s time to slow down and rest and when it’s time to be awake and focus. Adding a workout in the evening helps to establish this healthy habit. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid getting burnout, mix up your workouts and establish goals. For example, dealing with a hectic work schedule may mean consistency for you is a 20-minute workout each evening with a mix of high- and low-level intensity exercises. Taking that time each day for yourself gets your mind and body on daily cycle of activity and makes it easier once bedtime rolls around to go to sleep.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting with 20 minutes may be too much. Reduce it to 10 and keep the pace low. Stretching, yoga, or other gentle exercises may be just as beneficial if you make it routine. Keep in mind that what works for others may not work for you. A full cardio workout may be well-suited for the morning or during the day. Too much stimulation may keep you awake past your regular bedtime. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve tried multiple ways of working out in the evening and you feel it’s keeping you up at night, simply switch your schedule. For many, exercise has been known to help create regular sleep patterns, but only you can decide how much it’s helping you.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Exercise Benefits Sleep in Other Ways</span></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to regulating body temperature, alleviating stress, and helping to establish a routine, regular exercise helps in other ways, which ultimately leads to better sleep. First, it promotes a healthier immune system. The less you fall ill, the more sleep you’re able to get. Whenever cold season rolls around, nighttime coughs, sneezing, and other aches and pains keep people up for hours and make it uncomfortable for them to go to sleep. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By exercising as a means of preventative care, it can lead to less time being sick or less extreme cases. A bad cold or the flu will throw off even the most stringent of sleep schedules. Avoiding illness as much as possible is key. The long-held remedy of getting plenty of rest and drinking fluids holds true today.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to aiding with temporary illness, regular exercise reduces chronic pain and inflammation as well. Matching the exercise to your health or skill level is important to give your body what it needs. Do you regularly suffer from stiff joints and muscles? The gentle stretching of yoga or swimming at a consistent but leisurely pace gives you a workout without adding extra strain on the body. Alternatively, cardio workouts are beneficial for heart health and may reduce the amount of bloating or inflammation in the body. To add an additional precaution, it may also be helpful to research on the best sleeping position for lower back pain. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regular exercise along with a balanced diet also helps with weight management. Obesity often leads to certain sleep disorders like sleep apnea and insomnia. Essentially, sleep apnea causes you to stop and start breathing throughout the night and snore, both of which are sleep disruptors. These types of conditions means you’re not receiving regular sleep throughout the night and have to fight fatigue during the day. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s also important to keep in mind that increasing your level of activity affects your metabolism and make you hungrier than before. It’s best to refrain from eating several hours before bed to avoid acid reflux or heartburn, which affects sleep patterns. The body needs enough time to digest before entering a sleep phase, so it’s best to avoid late night eating. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When hunger strikes, choose your late-night snacks wisely. Foods like bananas, oatmeal, and cottage cheese are beneficial. They contain tryptophan, an amino acid used to create serotonin to relax the body and prepare it for sleep. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you’ve reached a place of good, consistent sleep, you’ll notice how much it improves other areas of health. Sometimes people pay attention to their diet and exercise without giving much thought to how well they’re sleeping at night. The benefits of quality sleep work in tandem with other daily habits and make just as much of a difference in a person’s overall health. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding What Works for You</span></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exercise in the evening is one of many ways to improve your sleep routine. However, it differs from person to person. For some, it tires the body out and allows it to relax, while others feel too stimulated after they’ve exercised to have it do any good. If you prefer to keep your workouts to daylight hours, another way to establish a beneficial bedtime routine is by keeping track of what’s keeping you up at night. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By recording your sleep habits, determining what is a normal sleeping pattern, and rating your sleep level, you’ll be able to identify what may be holding you back from better sleep. For example, are you waking up frequently throughout the night? If so, check the temperature in the room. A room that’s too hot or too cold will keep you up at night and prevent you from experiencing deep sleep. Is it difficult to find a comfortable position when sleeping? Evaluate the condition of your pillow, mattress, and bedding. You may need to replace them with something new. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several factors that play a part in how well we sleep. The point of finding a routine that is customized to you is understanding which of these factors provide you with your most optimal sleep and what detractors make you skimp. Eliminate the negative conditions and habits as much as possible and adapt to what promotes healthy sleep by creating positive habits. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lower the temperature in your room. Leave the electronics off in the hours leading up to bed. Or, try working out before sleep. List everything that is beneficial and prioritize your sleep as a significant part of your health. </span></p>",

By gradually cooling the bed, the thermo alarm enhances the natural body temperature change prior to wake up so that you feel refreshed as you get out of bed. The Pod also has numerous other features, like biometric tracking, sleep coaching and smart home integrations, meant to round out its offering as an all-in-one platform for better sleep. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humanity deserves to get more out of its time asleep, and the Pod brings us one step closer to delivering that.</span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You probably know by now just how much the temperature of your room can impact your sleep, for better or for worse. What you might not know is that the temperature of your actual bed can make just as much of a difference for your sleep.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bed temperature may be a major factor standing between you and a good night’s rest. Mattresses without proper airflow trap heat, leading to a night of tossing and turning. If the temperature of your bed has you sleeping too hot or sleeping too cool, it may be time to purchase a new mattress or bed topper.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what is the ideal bed temperature? Like many other aspects of sleep, it’s different for everyone. If you’re constantly waking up sweating or freezing, your mattress composition might be to blame. Typically, more people report sleeping hot than sleeping cold. Mattresses, specifically memory foam beds, can cause people to sleep hot because the foam the beds are made of doesn’t contain enough air pockets. Even some foam mattresses with cooling gel can trap heat.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It's important to remember that your bed is also a part of your bedroom environment. Most research suggests the temperature in your bedroom should be around </span><a href=\"https://site.eightsleep.com/blogs/news/should-you-really-sleep-at-68-degrees\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">68 degrees</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, depending on your age. Therefore, the temperature of your bed should be similar to what room temperature you sleep best at. The ideal bed temperature is </span><a href=\"https://thethirty.byrdie.com/best-temperature-for-sleep\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from 60-68 degrees </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and will change slightly as you age. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A majority of people report sleeping hot rather than cold, although there are certainly plenty of people who sleep cool. Waterbeds and innerspring beds without padding, for example, tend to cause people to sleep cool because there’s too much airflow.  Simply placing a memory foam topper or a heating pad on your mattress can help with your bed temperature regulation.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how do you control bed temperature? A </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bed like the <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eight Sleep Pod</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an even better option because it allows you to regulate the temperature, both cooling and heating to keep you comfortable. Your bed can be temperature controlled with the Eight Sleep app or setup automatically based on your sleep patterns. When used in conjunction with a variety of smart devices, you can have total bedroom temperature control. Body temperature changes throughout the night, so a mattress that can heat up and cool down as the body goes through different sleep cycles will lead to a better night's rest, guaranteed.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pod makes finding your ideal bed temperature easy. You can view your sleep data on the Eight Sleep app and see how your sleep changes as your body temperature changes throughout the night. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With bed temperature control, a better night’s sleep is in the forecast.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All sleep isn’t the same. REM, or rapid eye movement, is an important sleep stage. But the right amount of stage 3 of NREM sleep, also known as deep sleep, is crucial to a good night’s sleep and your overall health. Deep sleep helps to restore both your body and your brain. Feeling rested is impossible without the proper amount of deep sleep. So how exactly do you get more hours of deep sleep?</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Track sleep</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to start is to understand how much deep sleep you’re already getting. The Eight Sleep </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pod</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has built in piezo sensors that compile and analyze your sleep data nightly. You can view a full sleep report on the app and see how much deep sleep you’re averaging per night. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Relax</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking time to unwind before bed keeps you from staying awake late into the night thinking about daily life stressors. Whether through meditation, journaling or a number of other relaxation methods, it’s important to take time to calm your brain and body before bed.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>No bright lights</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You probably know by now that screen time before bed isn’t good for sleep. But those late night Netflix binges prevent you from getting better sleep more than you may realize. The blue light emitted from screens throws off your body’s internal clock, or circadian rhythm. Your brain is tricked into believing it’s not nighttime because of the light, making it harder to fall asleep and get enough deep sleep.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Maintain a healthy diet</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meals and drinks are easy to overlook when you think of getting more deep sleep. However, a healthy diet is key to a healthy sleep schedule. Avoid certain heavy foods like ice cream and pasta before bed. Caffeine should also be avoided at least two hours before you plan on going to bed. Besides caffeine, alcohol can also be detrimental to sleep. Cut out that nightcap when possible. Alcohol often makes you fall asleep easier, but it makes it harder for you to stay asleep throughout the night.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Keep bedtime consistent</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining a </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/how-to-keep-a-consistent-sleep-schedule\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep schedule</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is crucial to getting more deep sleep.

Luckily, there are certain actions you can take to try and improve your sleep while avoiding too much sweat.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>The Science</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hot flashes are one of the most common aspects of menopause. They occur in about </span><a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322351.php\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">85% of women </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the U.S. experiencing perimenopause and menopause. The changes in levels of estrogen and progesterone in a woman’s body lead to these uncomfortable hot flashes and night sweats. </span><a href=\"https://www.thesleepdoctor.com/2018/01/05/menopause-affects-sleep/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrogen also helps the body use serotonin</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that lead to sound sleep. When estrogen levels drop, there’s a rise in disrupted sleep. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As if hot flashes weren't frustrating enough, increased insomnia is also reported in women during peri to post menopause. </span><a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/menopause-pictures/tips-to-sleep-better-with-menopause.aspx#02\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">61% of women</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> experience insomnia during menopause. Without proper sleep, you’re more likely to feel irritable and less likely to function as well as you normally would during the day. It’s important to make sure your body gets all the sleep it needs as it experiences major changes. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>The Solutions</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the ideal room temperature for sleep differs for everyone, it is generally around <a href=\"https://site.eightsleep.com/blogs/news/should-you-really-sleep-at-68-degrees\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">68 degrees</a>. Turn the temperature in your bedroom down a few degrees cooler than what you’d normally set it at when you aren’t experiencing night sweats. This way, you’ll be less likely to wake up during the night when experiencing hot flashes. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleeping during hot flashes can also be improved by sleeping on a mattress with proper airflow that doesn’t trap body heat. A </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">cooling mattress like the Pod</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is the perfect option for regulating temperature so you can sleep better while having hot flashes. The Pod features dynamic temperature regulation, cooling down up to 55 degrees Fahrenheit to keep you comfortable in those hot sweaty nights.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">The Pod</a> allows you to change the temperature on each side of the bed whenever you feel too hot. You can even set your bed temperature to naturally lower at certain times throughout the night.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using a comfortable cooling pillow also helps to ensure you don’t wake up in a pool of sweat. </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/the-cool-pillow?variant=12289047887960\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adjustable cool pillows</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are ideal since you can remove and add layers so you always get the right support.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trying different solutions like the ones mentioned above and keeping track of the results can be overwhelming. However, a </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/eight-sleep-tracker?variant=34186577923\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep tracker</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> helps you to track how well you slept when using a certain sleep technique. Sleep trackers allow you to see how and when your body temperature changed so you can sleep better during menopause.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While body changes are inevitable in women, sleeping during menopause doesn’t have to feel impossible. Talk to your doctor or consult a sleep specialist if typical fixes for hot flashes while sleeping aren’t effective for you. </span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It seems that there are many nights we wake up covered in sweat. It is a fairly common issue, and while there are several possible causes for sweating at night, most obviously warm weather, we may not always know how to actually fix the issue. Learning how to sleep without sweating doesn’t have to be a big mystery. Check out these five useful secrets to help you sleep cool every night.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Cool down before bed</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your habits before bed significantly affect how you sleep during the night. If you already refrain from exercising at night but still sleep hot, there's another trick to try. Rubbing some ice or cold water on pressure points such as your wrists and temples helps to lower your body temperature. This way, you can fall asleep and sleep cool.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Wear your birthday suit</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe the most exhilarating but obvious secret to sleeping cool is to sleep naked. Clothes trap in heat and moisture, making you sleep hot. Ditching your pajamas in lieu of nothing is not only freeing, but it’s a fast way to a cool sleep. If you prefer to wear clothes to bed, just make sure to opt for breathable fabrics like organic 100% cotton. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Take it downstairs</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You probably know that heat rises, but it is easy to forget this simple, 3rd grade science fact when hot nights roll in. A big secret to sleeping cool is to sleep in the lowest possible area of your house. When the temperature rises, your mattress should lower. While it’s not feasible for everyone to bring a mattress downstairs during hot nights (specifically those of us who live in apartments), you can still sleep on a downstairs couch or even physically lower your bed frame if possible. Bear in mind that north facing rooms also tend to have a lower temperature. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Zip it, lock it, put it in the freezer</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A simple but clever trick to help you avoid sleeping hot is to freeze your fabrics. It may sound unconventional, but it works well. Take your bedsheets, and even pajamas and pillowcase if you like, and put them in a sealed gallon bag. Afterwards, simply set them in the freezer for a few hours. Take the bag out about a half hour before you plan on going to sleep. Fabrics at the right temperature will feel cool to the touch, and your body will want to fall asleep right away. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Ditch the heat trapping bed</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The secret is out: your bed is likely the number one culprit of you sleeping hot. If you’ve tried other methods to no avail, it might be time to get a new, high quality mattress with improved airflow. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">cooling mattress like the Pod</a> is</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a great option since it offers premium materials paired with a layer of technology that can cool down to 55 degrees Fahrenheit - and stay that cool all night! You’ll never be able to sleep if you have a hot bed or high room temperature, so try switching to a <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">cooler bed.</a></span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep well, not hot. </span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may be looking forward to the start of cooler temperatures, but for many sleepers the arrival of fall and cooler weather doesn’t necessarily mean the end of their excessive sweating.  While occasional night sweat is not a cause for alarm, continually waking up from overheating can be both annoying and unhealthy. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What are night sweats?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also known as nocturnal hyperhidrosis, night sweats are a fairly common condition present in certain men, women, and children.  Much like the name suggests, night sweats involve excessive sweating during the night, often resulting in pajamas and sheets drenched with sweat. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you repeatedly wake up to sheets wet from sweat with no outside cause, then you have experienced night sweats. It’s typical for people to wake up hot from external factors, but this isn't the same as actual night sweats. Waking up after an unusually hot summer night in a fan-less room or under five blankets covered in sweat doesn’t qualify as night sweats. Rather, night sweats are a physical condition that are not impacted by your sleep environment.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What causes night sweats?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Excessive sweating may seem worrisome, but night sweats can usually be explained quite easily. Night sweats may be a sign of an infection or medical condition. One of the most common reasons behind night sweats for women is menopause. There are also a variety of other less likely potential causes, such as low blood sugar and hormone disorders. Additionally, night sweats can also be an uncomfortable side effect of certain medications, particularly antidepressants.  </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Can you get rid of night sweats? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Excessively sweating at night can be uncomfortable and embarrassing. Even worse, night sweats leave you feeling gross and prevent a good night’s rest. Once you’ve identified that there are no external factors (unbreathable fabrics, hot room temperature, hot bed etc.) that are causing your excessive sweating, talk to your doctor to figure out potential health related causes. </span></p>",

However, it’s important to check that your room or bed isn't the main reason you get overheated in your sleep. Don't underestimate the role your mattress plays in helping you achieve good sleep. Always make sure that your mattress provides proper airflow and doesn’t trap body heat. Cheaply made memory foam mattresses, while comfy, often lack proper airflow.  Aside from replacing a poor quality mattress, you can adjust the temperature of your room until you find the perfect sleep temperature.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you still find that you sleep hot at night, there are a simple few tricks that can help cool your body down.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Sleep in cotton</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many hot sleepers, pajamas can stick to sweaty skin and make them even more uncomfortable.  Always make sure to choose</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span> </span>pajamas, underwear, pillow cases and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/all-organic-sheets?variant=34044136067\">sheets </a>made of 100% cotton.

With foam beds being oh so comfortable and oh so popular these days, your sleep is suffering. Try switching to a bed that merges comfort and active cooling, such as <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">the Pod</a>. It can cool down to 55 degrees Fahrenheit giving you the coolest most comfortable sleep all night, all year round.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Water and wind down</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re a hot sleeper, your bedtime rituals can make all the difference in helping you get a good night’s sleep. Take a cold washcloth or a few cubes of ice, and rub it on your pulse points before you turn in for the night. You should also keep a glass of ice next to the bed throughout the night as well. This way, if excessive sweating does wake you up, you can simply dab some water onto your forehead, temples, and wrists to cool you back down.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Shower</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The body naturally decreases in temperature before and during sleep. However, if you go to bed hot after an intense workout for example, it’s going to be harder for you to fall asleep due to your increased body temperature. Taking a shower may seem counterintuitive; why jump in hot water if I want to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lower </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my body temperature? It isn’t the shower so much that helps your body to cool down but rather the temperature change from hot water to cool air when you step out. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Use a cooling pillow </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are not very many people who haven't experienced waking up during the night feeling hot and flipping their pillow over to the cool side. However, you don't have to continuously flip over your pillow. By using a breathable <a href=\"https://site.eightsleep.com/products/the-cool-pillow?variant=12289047887960\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cooling pillow</a> that has natural cooling gel built in, both sides can be the cool sides. How cool is that?!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enacting these easy sleep solutions to sleeping hot will help you to reach a temperature where you can easily fall, and more importantly,<em> stay</em> asleep.</span></p>\n<p> </p>",

Temperature tells the body and brain when to wake up and fall asleep. Our body temperature naturally lowers before sleep, so it’s important that external temperature factors like blankets and sheets don’t interfere with the body’s natural circadian cycle.  Taking a shower before bed can also help your body temperature decrease so you can fall and stay asleep. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you sleep, your body temperature gradually changes. Body temperature rises slightly to help us wake up in the mornings. Cotton pajamas and </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/all-organic-sheets?variant=34044136067\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sheets</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are not only comfortable, but they help to regulate your body's natural sleep temperature as well. Even better? Sleep naked if you find yourself waking up in a pool of sweat. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Bed Temperature</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if your body temperature is properly regulated, your bed temperature can throw off your sleep. Certain materials in many memory foam mattresses can cause you to sleep hot. If your mattress doesn’t provide proper airflow, consider switching to a high quality </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" mce-data-marked=\"1\">cooling mattress such as <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">the Pod by Eight Sleep</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Bed temperature includes not only your mattress, but your pillows as well. The materials on your bed can cause you to sleep hot if they aren’t breathable, so always stick choose items with proper airflow. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Room Temperature </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During REM sleep, the body temperature is determined by the temperature of your bedroom. So in order to get a good night’s, you have to regulate your room temperature. The easiest way to change the room temperature so it best suits your sleep needs is to adjust or turn off the AC, heat and/or fan. Bear in mind that leaving the blinds open during the day can cause your bedroom to be overly hot at night. If your room is causing you to sleep cool, move your bed away from the windows as far as you can. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding the right sleep temperature means taking the time to make sure the temperatures of your room, mattress and body are properly regulated. Once you ensure that your sleep temperature is right for you, you’ll find that falling and staying asleep doesn’t have to be a nightly challenge. </span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you wake up covered in sweat or shivering wrapped in your bed sheets, then your bedroom is definitely not the right temperature for sleep.  Finding the perfect sleep temperature can be tricky, but there are a couple thing to focus on to make it easier. While most people sleep best around 68 degrees, there is no one room temperature that is right for everyone. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Adjust room temperature</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many sleepers, the ideal room temperature could be anywhere from 60-68 degrees. Finding out where you fall in that range may take some practice and adjustments, but eventually you’ll figure out what fan setting is right for you. No one wants to sleep hot, so simple things like keeping the blinds shut during the day can help you achieve your perfect sleep temperature. Keep in mind that the body naturally cools before sleep, so a cooler temperature generally helps you fall asleep quicker. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Check bed temperature </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your bed temperature may prevent you from falling and staying asleep at the perfect temperature. Try sleeping on your couch or an air mattress to determine if it’s your mattress that is causing you to sleep hot or cold. A hot bed is often a memory foam mattress that isn't designed to properly distribute air and moisture. Replacing your bed with a cooling bed such as <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">the Pod</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may help you achieve the right sleep temperature.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Choose cotton </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your bed sheets, pillowcases, and bed sheets all factor into finding the right sleep temperature. Fabrics like silk and satin aren't breathable enough for you to sleep comfortably. Always choose 100% cotton when it comes to sheets and pajamas.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also find your</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> own </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">perfect temperature for snoozing with some help from the </span><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eight-sleep/id1086913845?mt=8\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight app</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The app helps you track changes in your sleep to see how they correspond with the temperature in your room and that of the bed itself. By being aware of such factors that affect sleep temperature, you’ll be able to find the ideal bed temperature for you in no time.</span></p>\n<br><br><br><br>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are plenty of factors that play into getting a good night’s rest. One of the biggest factors is sleep temperature. But what exactly is the right temperature to sleep at?</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s important to remember that room temperature isn’t the only temperature that can affect sleep. In order to fall asleep quickly and sleep soundly, your body temperature and bed temperature have to be regulated as well. Room, body, and bed temperature combined make up sleep temperature. However, there’s no one right sleep temperature for everyone. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to the proper room temperature for sleep, somewhere between 60-68 degrees generally works. To find your perfect temperature, adjust the thermostat or fan setting in your room until you find the temperature you sleep best at. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may help to use a </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/eight-sleep-tracker?variant=34186577923\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep tracker </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to measure the improvement that a change in temperature brings to your sleep. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Body temperature is another factor to bear in mind. Before bed, our body temperature naturally lowers to help us fall asleep. However, habits like sleeping under a comforter in the summer and wearing unbreathable fabrics to bed can prevent this. Always opt for 100% cotton sheets and pajamas to avoid waking up shivering or covered in sweat. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another reason that you may sleep cool or sleep hot is your mattress. Bed temperature can prevent a good night’s rest if the bed is too hot or cold. For example, certain memory foam mattresses tend to trap air, making you sleep hot. If this is the case for you, consider switching to a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cooling mattress such as <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">the Pod</a>, which offers dynamic cooling as low as 55 degrees Fahrenheit and as high as 110. You may not need the extremes, however it guarantees to keep you comfortable all night long.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The right sleep temperature includes room, body and bed temperature. There is no one specific temperature that works for everyone, but following the above tips can help you find the temperature that results in your best sleep yet. </span></p>",

All the hype got us thinking -- how does our caffeine obsession affect our sleep?</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To find out more, we asked Eight sleepers how much and when they consume caffeine during the day. We correlated the responses to over 3,500 nights of sleep data from our Smart Mattresses and came up with some pretty interesting answers. Here’s what you should know about caffeine and sleep:</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>More coffee equals less sleep.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People lose 23 more minutes of sleep when they drink 4-6 servings of caffeine during the day compared to 1-2 servings. That may seem insignificant on a nightly basis, but if you regularly drink 4-6 servings, you could be looking at 6 full days of sleep loss yearly.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Drinking coffee in the morning affects your sleep less.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Users who drink their last cup of jo before noon sleep, on average, 20 minutes more than users who guzzle caffeine in the afternoon. Maybe you’re willing to lose those precious Zzzs, but you’ll likely be missing multiple sleep cycles in that time. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Coffee close to bedtime will delay sleep onset. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you drink coffee in the afternoon, you’ll take, on average, 10 more minutes to fall asleep than if you only drink it in the morning. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever your caffeine drinking habits are, we encourage you to enjoy National Coffee Day responsibly. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the best,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Eight Team </span></p>",

Some research claims that 68 degrees is the perfect room temperature for sleep, but is it really the temperature</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> everyone </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleeps best at?  Similar to other aspects regarding sleep, the answer is different from person to person.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">68 degrees may be ideal for some people, but figuring out your perfect sleep temperature isn’t always so simple. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What's more, your ideal sleep temperature isn’t consistent since it varies with age. As our bodies change, so should our sleep temperature. Adults should sleep anywhere from 60-68 degrees while babies and young children should sleep in a bit warmer environment, around 65-70 degrees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep quality decreases when temperatures radically drop or increase in the bedroom. Check to make sure your bedroom temperature is never </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8022726\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">below 54 degrees or above 75 </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">degrees since this greatly disrupts sleep. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ideal sleep temperature varies between genders as well. Generally, women prefer to sleep in slightly warmer environments than men because of differences in metabolism. Additionally, if you have insomnia, sleeping below 68 degrees may help to improve sleep. Many studies have shown that sleeping in cooler rooms increases sleep quantity and quality.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your bed temperature also affects what temperature your room should be at night. If you sleep hot, it may be because your mattress traps heat and doesn’t  provide proper airflow. Before you touch the thermostat, consider the fact that your bed may be the main reason you sleep cool or too hot. There are smart beds like the <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">Eight Sleep Pod</a>, which allow for dynamic temperature regulation. The Pod can cool all the way down to 55 degrees Fahrenheit on each individual bed side keeping you comfortable all night long.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, 68 degrees is a great temperature to start out with. However, if you find yourself still freezing under layers of blankets, then bundle up. If you wake up sweating or shivering, increase or decrease the temperature accordingly to get the best sleep possible. </span></p>",

So what exactly causes you to sleep hot?</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Room temperature</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the easiest fixes and biggest culprits of sleeping hot is the wrong room temperature. Ideally, the temperature in your room  should be around 60-68 degrees for optimal sleep. No one likes to sweat, so set a thermostat or run a fan at night to help you sleep better.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Poor quality memory foam mattress</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hot bed may likely be the cause of those night sweats. Many memory foam mattresses tend to sleep hot if they don’t have layers to allow proper  airflow. You don’t want your mattress to trap in moisture and heat from your body since this leads to a restless, hot night. Try the new <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">Pod by Eight Sleep</a>, which offers dynamic cooling and warming ranging from 55 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit. It is </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">designed to help you sleep cool </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smart.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Unbreathable fabrics</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Silk and satin pajamas and bed sheets may sound luxurious, but in reality they’re not doing you any favors. Substitute unbreathable fabrics for cotton, specifically bamboo cotton, with better airflow to keep you sleeping cool. Eight’s 300 thread count organic cotton </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/all-organic-sheets?variant=34044136067\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sheets</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are a great option that are not only cool, but comfy as well. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>High humidity</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on where you live and the structure of your house, high humidity can be a problem in colder months as it is in warmer months. Try using a dehumidifier at night to avoid feeling like you’re sleeping in a Florida swamp. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Medications</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many prescriptions, especially antidepressants, have the uncomfortable side effect of sleeping hot. Even some basic over the counter pain relievers can produce this side effect in some people. If possible, consider swapping out your medication for a slightly different kind that doesn’t cause a sleep problem.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you try these fixes and still find yourself sweating each night, talk to your doctor since this could indicate a more serious problem. </span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ve probably had many restless nights where you lay awake wondering why you can’t sleep. As it turns out, sweating at night is a common cause of sleeplessness. There are a number of possible reasons as to why you sweat at night, but luckily most of them have simple fixes. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Pillow with poor airflow</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many pillows, particularly those made of memory foam, make it too hot to sleep at night. To help you sleep cool, try a pillow with cooling gel or a more advanced kind made with special cooling nylon. Eight’s </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/the-cool-pillow?variant=12289047887960\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cool Pillow</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an adjustable pillow that makes both sides of the pillow the cool side, is a great option that helps you avoid night sweats.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Mattress with poor airflow</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A bed that traps body heat and moisture is unsurprisingly going to cause you to sweat during the night. Replacing your hot bed with one that provides dynamic cooling like <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">the Pod</a>, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will help you stop sweating and start sleeping cool. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Wrong room temperature</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your room is set at a higher temperature than about 68 degrees, you’ll likely be sweating all through the night. Make sure your room temperature isn’t too hot by shutting the blinds during the day and running a fan at night if necessary.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Too heavy bed sheets</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleeping with too many blankets on your bed, especially sheets that aren’t cotton, can cause you to sweat at night. Additionally, keeping a down comforter on your bed all year round isn’t doing your body any favors. Remove extra layers and your comforter if you find yourself being too hot to sleep. Cotton is really the only material you should have on your bed and your body at night. Untreated cotton is breathable, comfy, and cool. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Menopause</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, hot flashes are common for women right before and during menopause. Hot flashes caused by shifts in hormones can trigger these hot flashes during the day as well as nighttime.  If you have tried everything else and suspect this is the cause of your sleep problem, talk with your doctor about ways to deal with hot flashes at night. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Alcohol before bed</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drinking too close to bedtime, about two hours of less, can cause you to sleep hot and make it difficult to stay asleep. It messes with your body’s natural temperature decrease before bed, causing you to sweat during the night. Avoid those nightcaps if you want a better sleep.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Exercise too close to bed</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid exercise at least two hours before bed. Your body naturally starts to cool down before sleep, and intense exercise can prevent your body’s thermoregulation.  Working out increases your heart rate and metabolism. This in turn increases the heat that your body produces, making it hard to sleep. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you know why you sweat at night, it’s a lot easier to sleep cool and wake refreshed. </span></p>\n<br><br>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes it seems like there really is no beating the heat, even at night. But you don’t have to spend every night sweating instead of sleeping. Here are some of the best tips to follow when you want to sleep cool. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Freeze it</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it’s not a permanent solution, simply sticking your folded sheets in a bag and putting them in the freezer can help you sleep cooler. You can also try this sleep hack with your pajamas. Enveloping yourself in cool materials helps you fall asleep at the perfect temperature. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Get cold feet</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since there are multiple nerve endings in feet, dipping your feet in cool water before bed helps you sleep cooler. You can also keep a small bowl of ice near your bed to rub on your temples and feet if you wake up hot in the middle of the night. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Buy cool products</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure your sleep products offer breathability. Your mattress, pillow, pjs, and bed sheets all need to provide proper air circulation. Cotton sheets and pjs stop the sweat since cotton is a highly breathable fabric. When it comes to your mattress, opt for breathable materials as well. Consider a <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">mattress that offers dynamic cooling</a>, so you won’t sleep hot. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Change sleeping position</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spread out as much as possible while you’re sleeping. Think like a starfish, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">be </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the starfish. Falling asleep in this position allows for air to circulate around your body. Sleeping sprawled out is the sleeping position most effective in reducing body heat. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Monitor diet</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eating small meals often throughout the day helps to reduce the heat caused by your metabolism. Keep in mind portion size as well as the type of food you’re eating. Don’t eat spicy foods at least three hours before bed in order to avoid sweating at night. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Shower before bed</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don’t want to sleep hot, take a cool shower before bed. When you step out of the shower into the even cooler air, your body temperature naturally drops, making it easier to fall asleep. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Sleep alone</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much like Drake, many people hate sleeping alone. However, sleeping in a separate bed from your partner can actually lead to better sleep for both of you. This way, you don’t have to endure extra body heat, and you can both sleep cooler. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Unplug</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turn off the tech.  Devices like phones and computers radiate heat, making it harder to fall asleep. Even electrical sockets give off heat, so unplug all unnecessary chargers and cords before climbing into bed. </span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are many </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/tips-to-stop-sweating-at-night\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tips</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you can use to stay cool at night, they won’t help much if your sleep products are the main culprits causing you to sleep hot. Check out the list below of the top five products to help you sleep cool.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>1. Cooling mattress  </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best mattress tips is to purchase mattress that offers proper breathability. But, with all the advances of technology, there are now solutions that go beyond that. One example is <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">the Pod</a>, the only mattress that dynamically cools to as low as 55 degrees on each bed side. This allows for the maximum cooling to keep you comfortable all night long. A cool mattress can make all the difference in sleep quality. If your mattress does not allow for proper airflow, there’s no way you’ll be able to make it through the night without sweating. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Cooling pillow</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some foam pillows are available with a cooling gel layer on one side so you don’t constantly have to flip the pillow over during the night. For those that want a cooling pillow tailored to them, the </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/the-cool-pillow?variant=12289047887960\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cool Pillow by Eight </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a great option. It’s a customizable pillow that offers 9 possible comfort setups and is constantly cool to the touch. Rather than one simple gel layer, this pillow provides the utmost cooling with its highly breathable layers and cooling nylon material.</span><b></b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<li style=\"display: inline !important;\"><strong>3. Cotton pajamas</strong></li>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don’t feel comfortable sleeping naked, going to bed in a pair of cotton pajamas will help you stay cool. </span><a href=\"https://cottonon.com/US/women/womens-sleepwear/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cotton On </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">offers a variety of options for both men and women in many styles. Bamboo cotton is a top quality material to help you stay cool at night. While materials like silk might be more appealing, cotton pjs are far more comfy, breathable, and prevent you from waking up drenched in sweat.</span><b></b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<li style=\"display: inline !important;\"><strong>4. Cotton sheets and pillowcases</strong></li>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like pajamas, your sheets and pillowcases should be 100% cotton as well. Since cotton is both soft and lightweight, it’s an extremely breathable material. The organic 300 thread count </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/collections/sheets\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sheets </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from Eight ensure you sleep comfy </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cool.</span><b></b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<li style=\"display: inline !important;\"><strong>5. Cooling eye mask</strong></li>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wearing a sleep mask to bed can not only block out light that prevents you from falling asleep, but masks with cooling gel can actually help you sleep cooler. Choose a cotton sleep mask with removable cooling gel packs for each eye.  As an added bonuses, many cool sleep masks can also help prevent puffy eyes.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By choosing the right sleeping products, you can stay cool all night long. </span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We probably all have an idea of whether we’re a night person or a morning person. But when it comes to figuring out when you’re actually most alert, things can get a bit more complicated.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>So just how do you determine when you’re most alert? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"http://www.cet-surveys.com/index.php?sid=61524\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MEQ test</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or Morningness Eveningness questionnaire, allows you to measure when your circadian rhythm gives you peak alertness, in the morning, at night, or somewhere in between. Usually, peak alertness corresponds with peak body temperature. Thus, if you’re more alert in the evening, that is when your body temperature is highest, and vice versa. This is a fairly easy self assessment with only 19 questions to determine when you are the most alert. There are also shorter versions available with about 5 questions that are more broad.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Why bother to take an MEQ assessment? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s important to know when you are most alert so you can plan your day around it. You can schedule activities that require more mental and physical power during the hours when you’re most alert. If you’re more awake in the evening, then that is the best time to get work done. You can determine your circadian rhythm type. It’s also important to know because if you can’t shift your schedule to match your circadian rhythm, you can know you need to use light therapy to shift your body’s natural circadian rhythm. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Does it remain the same?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind that your MEQ score </span><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep45874\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">changes overtime</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You may very well go from a morning lark to an evening owl. As we age, we alternate between morningness and evening. There are a number of factors that must be taken into account, namely gender, but the pattern tends to go  from morningness to eveningness and back to morningness. As infants, we’re high morningness, but there’s a turn towards eveningness from as early on as our toddler years. We continue on this path towards dramatically higher eveningness.  Around ages 16-19, there’s a slow change back to morningness. During adulthood, there is a gradual return towards morningness although it does not get nearly as high as it was during infancy. </span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve all been there: it’s early on a Monday morning, and you’re dreading going to work. “Manic Monday” starts playing in your head, and you decide a few extra minutes won’t hurt. But don’t hit that snooze button just yet. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is actually harm in snoozing too long after your alarm goes off. Pressing the snooze button every once in awhile won’t do much harm, but making a habit of it can actually make you feel more tired during the day. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you wake up, you’ve typically just finished the REM cycle. So if you hit snooze as soon as your alarm goes off, your body and brain go right back into the REM cycle. As your alarm continues to go off and you keep hitting snooze, you repeatedly go in and out of this cycle. When you finally do wake up and stay up, you’ll wake up in the middle of the REM cycle. Waking up during this cycle will leave you feeling very drowsy.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, there are some products that can help prevent this. For example, Eight’s </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smart alarm</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can wake you up within a half hour of your alarm so you wake up during your lightest sleep stage feeling refreshed. As long as you don’t hit snooze, there’s no worry of waking up groggy in the middle of REM.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there’s another negative result of snoozing. Usually your body is ready to get up when your alarm goes off (assuming you didn’t stay up until 2am the night before binging Netflix). However, continually hitting snooze can throw your body’s natural rhythm out of sync. This will lead to difficulty falling asleep at night because your body doesn’t know when it’s time to sleep or be awake. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As hard as it is to hear, the less you hit snooze, the better. Waking up early is never fun, but after awhile it will become easier and more natural.</span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Life is full of decisions, from choosing between salt or sugar for the rim of your margarita to picking out the perfect mattress. When it comes to making bigger financial decisions, so many options can leave you feeling overwhelmed. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choosing a mattress is a very personal decision. We’ve created an easy way to choose a mattress that takes into account your different sleeping needs. By bearing in mind these factors, you’ll be cozy and relaxed in your new bed in no time.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Sleep position and mattress firmness</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing which type of sleeper you are is the first step in choosing the right mattress for you.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Side sleepers:</b><span> Since side sleepers often move around during the night, a soft to medium level of firmness is ideal. A softer mattress helps to relieve the pressure on the neck and back that comes with sleeping on your side. 3-5.5 out of 10.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Stomach sleepers:</strong> <span>More than any other position, stomach sleepers need proper support. A mattress that is too soft can lead to spine misalignment and lower back pain. 5-7.5 out of 10.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Back sleepers:</strong> <span>Support and firmness should be the main factors. A mattress that is soft enough to relieve pressure points but also firm enough to prevent any spine misalignment is perfect for back sleepers. 4-7 out of 10.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><b>Budget and brand</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dropping six month’s salary on a mattress doesn’t guarantee it is better than a less expensive model. Ideally, your budget should be around $600-$1300. Bear in mind that retail stores often inflate prices. Many online mattress companies like Eight remove markups and offer </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/pages/financing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">financing programs </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so you can get the bed of your dreams without a nightmare of debt. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Tech obsessed and smart mattress capabilities </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you want your mattress to help improve the quality of your life in addition to helping you sleep better? If so, then buying a smart mattress is the best decision you can make. Smart mattresses such as those from </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/pages/mattress-collections\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">track your sleep automatically. This allows you to view sleep specifics and learn how your daily life impacts your time spent asleep. Additionally, many smart mattresses hook up to other smart devices like WeMo coffee makers and Amazon Alexa. You can either purchase a smart bed, or make any mattress smart by placing a </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/eight-sleep-tracker\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep tracker</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over it.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Body type and mattress comfort </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bear in mind that mattress firmness is based on the average sleeper (about 180 pounds). Since most mattresses are designed for the average sleeper, anything in the universal comfort range or medium-firm range is ideal. The more you weigh, the harder foam has to work to support your body. A firmer mattress tends to provide the support needed for those on the heavier side (200 pounds and above). For those on the lighter side, soft mattresses are best since you don’t have to worry about sinking into the mattress. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Square footage and mattress size </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people opt for queen sized beds. Depending on the layout of your bedroom, a full size mattress may be the better option. You want your mattress to accommodate you and any potential partners. If you’re sleeping alone, make sure your mattress is big enough for you to roll over about one and a half times.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Additional sleepers and bounce </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you sleep alone or with a partner, pets, and/or kids? If you’re not sleeping alone, a mattress with minimal movement transfer is the best option. Buying a mattress with more layers of support provides less bounce, so you won’t be disturbed by anyone moving in bed next to you.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more mattress shopping tips, check out </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/mattress-buying-guide-how-to-shop-for-a-mattress\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<br><br>",

Luckily, there a few things you can do to stop sweating at night.</p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Invest in breathable, quality sheets</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t let your sheets be the cause of overheating. While satin may feel nice, cotton sheets are by far the best material since they are the most breathable.

Many memory foam mattresses tend to sleep hot. Make sure to choose a bed that is both comfy </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cool. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cooling mattress like <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">the Pod </a>combines</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> foam with technology that dynamically cools each bed side to as low as 55 degrees. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Sleep naked or wear breathable fabrics to bed</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are so many </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/this-is-why-you-should-be-sleeping-naked\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefits of sleeping naked</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one of the major ones being it helps prevent you from waking up drenched in sweat. Your body temperature naturally drops during sleep, but going to bed in PJs, especially ones that aren’t 100% cotton, could disrupt the body’s natural cycle. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Remove your bed comforter during warmer months</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chances are you have a down comforter on your bed year round. Many people don’t think of removing their comforter all together or replacing it with a thinner quilt, but this can make all the difference. You don’t go to bed in sweatpants and socks during the summer, and you shouldn’t go to bed under a giant, warm comforter either. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Get a cooling pillow</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes all it takes to stop sweating at night is new pillow. The adjustable </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/the-cool-pillow?variant=12289047887960\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cool Pillow </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from Eight continuously gives you that “cool side of the pillow” feeling. Be sure to opt for pillowcases made of breathable fabrics as well. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Rub ice or water on your wrists before bed</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may sound too simple to actually work, but rubbing ice or cold water on your wrists and/or hands before bed actually helps to cool you down. Your body temperature lowers before bed, and this helps to make sure you don’t overheat at night. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Check the temperature of your room</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your room is too hot, then you’re bound to spend more time sweating than sleeping.  Make sure the thermostat in your bedroom is set to anywhere from 63-68 degrees at night. Turn on the fan or AC if needed. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you still find that you’re excessively sweating, talk to your doctor. </span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is sleep fragmentation? Sleep fragmentation is basically repeated, short sleep interruptions during the night which leads to excessive tiredness during the day. These interruptions disrupt the natural sleep schedule and stages. While it isn’t categorized as a sleep disorder, it is often a symptom of a sleep disorder.</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People with fragmented sleep tend to fall asleep quickly but wake up multiple times during the night for short periods of time. These sleep fragmentations are not the natural ones that occur in humans but rather unnatural disturbances that lead to sleep interruptions that you remember during the daytime. </span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><b>Causes </b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned, sleep fragmentation is usually a symptom of a sleep disorder such as narcolepsy or sleep apnea. Experiencing body pain affects sleep fragmentation since you’re more likely to continuously awake if you’re in pain during the night. Snoring affects sleep fragmentation as well since people can wake themselves up from their own snoring. </span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><b>Effects</b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest effect of sleep fragmentation is extreme fatigue during the day due to a lack of proper sleep. Not only can sleep fragmentation lessen your amount of sleep each night, but it can also lead to weight gain and certain mood disorders. You’re far more likely to be unhappy when you don’t get the proper amount of sleep each night. Moreover, when short sleep arousals occur frequently, it can </span><a href=\"http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/17/4/723\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lead to leg movements</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and increased snoring, making it even harder to sleep. </span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><b>Treatment</b></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Testing for and treating an underlying sleep disorder helps with sleep fragmentation. Other treatments involve improving sleep hygiene, using tips like going to bed and waking up at the same time every day. A </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/eight-sleep-tracker\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep tracker </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can help you see how often you wake up during the night and for how long in order to determine if you have fragmented sleep or suffer from a different sleep interruption. Cognitive behavioral therapy and relaxation training may also help treat the issue. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep fragmentation is very common and not something to brush aside just because it isn’t technically a sleep disorder. Track your sleep each night to see how often you wake up during the night, and talk to your doctor about diagnosing a sleep disorder that is likely associated with your frequent sleep interruptions. </span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Falling asleep can be challenging, but actually staying asleep can be even harder. Chances are, you don’t have an uninterrupted sleep every single night. While this may sound like a problem, it isn’t necessarily always a bad thing.</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two different types of disturbances that cause sleep breaks: natural and external disturbances. </span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><b>Natural </b></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your body naturally wakes you up when something is wrong, whether that is because you are sick, need to go to the bathroom, or your body is too hot or cold. This is your body’s way of making sure you stay healthy. If you weren’t awakened, you could face anything from a UTI to heat exhaustion. For example, many people get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. This isn’t as much of a problem as you think since the body wakes you up at the right time between sleep stages. In other words, you aren’t awakened during deep sleep, so it’s significantly easier to wake up and fall back asleep. Still, it can be annoying to wake up naturally during the night. You can improve your sleep and lessen sleep breaks by ensuring your room is a comfortable temperature each night and reducing the amount of water you drink an hour or less before bed. </span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><b>External </b></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">External forces such as screaming babies, noisy neighbors, and an accidental kick in the shin from a partner all interrupt sleep. When an outside force is causing you to wake up, the sleep disturbance is unnatural and thus an issue. Since it isn’t your body that’s waking you up, you’ll have a more difficult time falling back asleep. Falling back asleep may also prove harder because you’re more likely to be awakened during a cycle of deep sleep by external forces as opposed to natural ones. Additionally, it’s easy to solve natural sleep disturbances because once you go to the bathroom or grab an extra blanket, you can usually go right back to sleep. However, external disturbances that suddenly interrupt sleep jolt your brain into activity as you piece together what exactly woke you up. Often, our minds tend to wander when this happens, making it more difficult to fall asleep. You can minimize external sleep disruptions by using ear plugs and a sleep mask at night. These items will block out a lot of factors in your sleep environment that could wake you up during the night.</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waking up during the night can be annoying, but when your body is waking you up, it’s to ensure your own good health. In the end, we all want uninterrupted sleep. Try a sleep tracker to help minimize sleep disturbances. With increased understanding of sleep and the ability to see how often you wake up during the night, you’ll be able to sleep better. </span></p>",

            "created_at": "2018-08-15T20:03:10-04:00",
            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having trouble falling and/or staying asleep at night can be extremely frustrating. What’s more frustrating is not knowing </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">why </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you’re having trouble sleeping. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of factors that could be negatively affecting your sleep. Luckily, there are simple solutions to each of them. Check out the top six factors that affect sleep and how to fix them. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><b>1. Caffeine</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consuming caffeine in the evenings will lead to disrupted sleep. Be aware of the caffeine in soda, coffee, and tea. A cup of coffee after dinner or tea before bed can be calming, but make sure to opt for decaf. Caffeine free tea like Sleepy Time tea can actually help you relax and fall asleep faster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><b>2. Smoking</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nicotine is a stimulant, making it hard for smokers to fall asleep. Smokers often have far more disputed sleep patterns as well. The more you smoke, the more likely you may be to develop insomnia. Smoking also changes your circadian rhythm which leads to poor sleep. Smoking two hours before bed makes it more likely that you’ll have a poor night’s rest. If you’re going to smoke, smoke your last cigarette of the day well before bedtime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><b>3. Marijuana</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smoking marijuana on the other hand can have a much different effect on sleep and sleep quality. Marijuana helps to restore the body’s natural sleep cycle. THC helps to induce sleep, but it decreases REM or dream sleep, leading to a deeper sleep. Opt for a strain of indica over sativa as indica has a more relaxing effect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><b>4. Sleeping pills</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a high risk of addiction when it comes to sleeping pills. With melatonin, you’ll need an increased amount for it to work. Sleeping pills will eventually make it harder for your body to fall asleep naturally. If you do need a pill to fall asleep, limit the dosage and don’t take one every single night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><b>5. Special Diet </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people may feel tired during the day when fasting, but daily performance is typically not affected. However, fasting affects our sleep whether we realize it or not. Food deprivation often increases wakefulness. For those who fast during Ramadan or other religious holidays, beginning to fast for shorter amount of times for the days leading up to the fasting period can help your body become acclimated, thus reducing fasting negative effect on sleep. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><b>6. Sex</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sex before bed can make it easier to fall asleep. This is a no brainer since most people are typically exhausted after exerting so much energy. Sex also lowers cortisol, a stress related hormone that can make it difficult to fall asleep. However, this isn’t true for everyone. If you find yourself more stimulated and awake after sex, avoid it right before bed. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being aware of what might be affecting your sleep is the first step towards a good night’s rest.</span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting a good night’s sleep doesn’t have to be hard. There are small measures you can take nightly to ensure you wake rested, refreshed, and relax. Check out these six easy habits to improve your sleep.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>1. Limit naps</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A little extra sleep doesn’t hurt, unless your </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/the-pros-and-cons-of-napping\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">naps</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are too long and/or too close to bedtime. Limit naps to no more than an hour.  Avoid napping past 5 o’clock as it will make it harder to fall asleep at night since your body already feels rested.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>2. Shower before bed</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Showering before bed will lead to improved sleep. Your body temperature decreases during sleep, so lowering it before bed will help improve sleep. Taking a hot shower and then allowing your body to adjust to the cooler air helps to lower your internal body temperature. Ideally, you should shower about 90 minutes before you plan on going to sleep.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><b>3. Watch what you eat before bed</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eating too close to bedtime definitely affects your sleep. Certain types of food affect sleep differently than others. Eating late at night, especially sugary foods,  can increase your blood sugar, causing a sugar rush that makes it seemingly impossible to fall asleep. Foods with magnesium actually help you achieve a deeper sleep, but make sure your last meal is at least an hour before bed. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>4. Workout in the morning </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working out before bed increases your body temperature and heart rate, two things that make it difficult to fall asleep. However, exercise before bed affects everyone differently. For some people, exhaustion from exercise before bed actually helps them sleep better. You know your body best, so avoid workout three hours or closer to bedtime if you find your sleep is negatively affected. Overall, people who exercise sleep better than those who don’t. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>5. Turn on night mode</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blue light is emitted from screens on laptops, tablets, and phones. The shorter wavelengths in this type of light causes the body to produce less melatonin, a chemical that is important for sleep. Try reading or writing before bed instead, or turn on night mode to limit the amount of blue light emitted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><b>6. Avoid alcohol before bed</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s easy to brush aside alcohol as having an impact on your sleep. In fact, consuming beer, wine, or liquor before bed can actually help you to fall asleep. However, alcohol three hours before bed or later will lead to disruptions during the night, and you’ll find it hard to fall asleep. Certain types of grapes contain melatonin, so indulging in a glass of wine before bed won’t necessarily disrupt sleep that much. The more alcohol you consume, the hardest it is to stay asleep at night. If your idea of a Friday night is having drinks with friends, start early and end with some mocktails to avoid a restless sleep. Besides, who doesn’t love happy hour deals? </span></p>\n<br><br>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many factors that contribute to good sleep, from a supportive mattress to avoiding certain foods before bed. One of the key factors to a restful sleep is maintaining the ideal body temperature at night.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>The Basics</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Body temperature is largely affected by room temperature. In order for your body to properly regulate its temperature, the conditions of your sleeping environment have to be just right. Set the temperature in your bedroom around 61-68 to help you fall and stay asleep comfortably. If external temperature conditions aren’t right, then your body will alternate between shivering and sweating (except during Rapid Eye Movement or</span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/the-difference-between-rem-and-deep-sleep\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> REM</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), making for an unpleasant sleep.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the REM sleep stage, your body stops regulating temperature on its own. Instead, your body takes on the temperature of your environment. Humans become temporarily cold blooded during REM. If the temperature in your room varies greatly from the temperature your body was at before REM, then you’ll become very cold or wake up drenched in sweat. When you come out of REM sleep, you may shiver or sweat if your room (and consequently body temperature) isn’t comfortable. Extreme temperature changes can wake you up and make it hard to fall back asleep.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>The Answers</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your body temperature naturally drops during sleep so your brain can enter deep sleep and changes throughout the night. During NREM sleep, both your body and brain temperature decrease. In order to get the proper amount of restful sleep each night during all sleep stages, there are a few things you can do regarding temperature.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep happens when your core temperature drops. If your core temperature doesn't drop or doesn’t drop enough, you’ll have trouble falling and staying asleep. To help your core temperature drop, shower before bed. This actually helps to cool your body down when your warm body steps into the colder air after showering. Wearing breathable fabrics to bed (namely cotton) also helps you to sleep well. Additionally, buying a pillow and sheets that allow for proper air flow are key to ensuring your body temperature stays where it needs to be. The breathable, 100% organic </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/collections/sheets\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cotton sheets from Eight </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are a great option. If you still find that you’re sleeping too hot, try a mattress with dynamic cooling like the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" mce-data-marked=\"1\"><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">Pod </a>by Eight Sleep</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bottom line is if your body temperature isn’t ideal, then your sleep won’t be either.

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many hours of sleep did you get last night? Was it enough so that you woke up feeling rested? While many people believe eight hours of sleep each night is what everyone needs, that’s actually a bit of a misconception. So how much sleep do you actually need?</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer is different for everyone, and it depends on a number of factors. There’s a difference between getting just enough sleep to survive and getting the right amount of sleep each night so you thrive, both physically and mentally.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Genes</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all know that one person who claims to only need a few hours of sleep each night and seem to miraculously function just fine. In reality, only 1% of people are born with the genes to thrive on six hours of sleep or less. So while some people may think they’re thriving on six hours of sleep or less, they’re actually only getting enough sleep to survive. If they got the proper amount of sleep each night, they’d be more productive during the day overall and would actually increase their chances of living a longer,healthier life. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The body rejuvenates itself during sleep, so it’s important to sleep long enough that your body has time to do its thing. The majority of adults need anywhere from 7-8.5 hours per night in order for their bodies and minds to thrive.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Age</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since teenagers bodies are still developing, it makes more sense that they’d need more sleep than adults to thrive, about 8.5-10 hours. Most teenagers only get enough sleep to survive, but an increase of sleep could help them thrive academically and improve their health.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By that logic, many people wrongly believe that the elderly need less sleep because their bodies are fully developed. The reasoning that older people need less sleep to thrive is actually a myth. It was assumed since older people have a harder time staying asleep that they don’t need as much sleep. However, maintaining the same amount of sleep at 65 that you had at 35 can actually help to improve overall health and possibly decrease age related cognitive decline. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Gender</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-news/do-women-need-more-sleep-men\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multiple studies </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have found that women need more sleep than men. Women need about twenty more minutes of sleep each night than men. Why? Women generally tend to use more of their brain since they multitask, leading to an increased need for sleep. Additionally, women go through more hormonal changes than men i.e. menopause and pregnancy, so their bodies need extra sleep. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, everybody needs a different amount of sleep. Getting the right amount of sleep each night will help both your body and mind to thrive.  In order to achieve the optimum amount of sleep, you need to know exactly how much sleep you’re currently getting. A sleep tracker like E</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ight’s built in </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/eight-sleep-tracker?variant=34186577923\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep tracker</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will tell you how much sleep you’re getting and how to improve it. </span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From counting sheep to popping melatonin, you’ve probably heard a lot of different methods to help you fall asleep. But what techniques actually help you fall asleep faster?</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Clear your mind</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all tend to have a million things run through our heads as soon as we lay down at night. Midnight on a work night isn’t exactly the time you want to think about your ex or that time you accidentally called your teacher “mom” in middle school. Set aside some time each night to clear your mind before bed. A simple breathing exercise can help you fall asleep quicker. A short meditation or mindfulness session can also help to clear your mind and make you feel more relaxed before bed. There are plenty of free meditation apps available like Calm, and the Eight app has recorded meditation sessions as well.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Sleep soundly</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you need to drown out noisy neighbors or just want to listen to some relaxing noises as you fall asleep, putting on some ambient noise can help sleep to come quickly. You can choose from a variety of sounds, from waves crashing to cats purring.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Schedule worry time</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all have stressors in our lives, and it’s only natural to spend time worrying. Unfortunately, many of us tend to spend time worrying once we climb into bed for the night, making it nearly impossible to fall and stay asleep. Try to set aside some time at least an hour or so before bed to go over your thoughts. Often writing down some of your worries and realizing that many things are out of your control helps you fall asleep sooner and ultimately sleep better.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Avoid the obvious</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s so tempting to end the day by watching television or scrolling through Instagram, but the blue light emitted from screens makes it very difficult to fall asleep quickly. Avoid screens as well as caffeine at least a couple of hours before bed. Another habit to avoid? Taking naps too late in the day and napping longer than a half hour or so will mess up your body’s natural clock, making it harder to fall asleep at night.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Wake up schedule consistency</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main ways to fall asleep faster is to </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/sleep-wake-time-consistency\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">regulate your sleep schedule. </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waking up and falling asleep at around the same time every day is so important. Once your body gets used to a sleep schedule, you’ll find you fall asleep quickly and easily.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Body temperature</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Body temperature naturally drops during sleep. So before bed, you don’t want your body temperature to increase. This means no late night exercise; get that gym time in during the early morning. Additionally, taking a warm bath or shower before bed helps you to relax and fall asleep quicker; it actually helps to lower your body temperature after you step into the cool air post shower. You can achieve this same effect with a <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">smart bed</a> too, which offer dynamic temperature regulation to relax you and help you fall asleep and stay soundly asleep.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By following these easy methods, you’ll be able to fall asleep faster each night. Sweet dreams! </span></p>",

However, when shopping for a mattress, comfort is one of the most important things to take into account. You want a mattress that is perfect for both your sleep and your sex life. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There a few main factors that indicate the best mattress for sex. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Firmness</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This one may seem obvious, but a firm bed is crucial. You don’t want a bed that is so soft you sink into it. Since your bed can’t pop a pill to fix that problem, opt for a medium firm to firm mattress. You want the weight of two people to be distributed evenly, no matter what positions you’re in. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Breathability </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s important to choose a mattress that doesn’t trap heat. Chances are, you get sweaty enough without a heat trapping mattress adding to it. Make sure you pick a mattress like the </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/the-mars-plus?variant=43186834371\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mars + </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that is made with extra breathable foam and spring coils to help improve air flow. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Size</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It does matter. An intimate moment can be ruined in an instant if one of you suddenly falls off of the bed. You want to ensure that your bed is large enough so that you both can enjoy those steamy nights.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Minimal to zero noise</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing can kill a mood more than a squeaky bed. Whether you have kids, roommates, or just thin walls in your apartment, a silent bed is key when it comes to uninhibited sex. Foam mattresses and hybrid beds are overwhelmingly more quiet than innerspring beds. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Comfort</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your mattress is uncomfortable, you’ll be uncomfortable. Sex is to be enjoyed; it’s not something to rush through because of back pain from an unsupportive mattress. Instead, choose a mattress with many layers of premium, supportive foam like any of </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/pages/mattress-collections\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight’s foam mattresses</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Responsive layers/Bounce</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mattress needs to fit your bodies as you move so you feel supported; it should bounce back a bit instead of just engulfing you.You’re going to be moving a lot, so a mattress with minimal movement transfer is ideal. A hybrid mattress that contains foam and coils like the</span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/the-mars-plus?variant=43186834371\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Mars+  </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provides a nice push back and has just the right bounce needed to enjoy the experience to its fullest. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With its breathability, firmness, and premium foam layers combined with coils,  </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/the-mars-plus?variant=43186834371\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mars+</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  is the perfect mattress for out of this world sex.</span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re looking for tips for sleep that actually work, you’re not alone. The most important thing you can do for better sleep is regulate sleep wake time consistency. You can’t have mac and cheese without cheese, and you can’t have good sleep without routine.  But just how do you regulate it?</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consistency is crucial because your body needs to get in natural and healthy habits to improve your sleep quality and avoid sleep deprivation and oversleeping.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Wake time consistency</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must wake up at or very near to the same time every single day, even on weekends. Use the Eight app to set an alarm for around the same time every day. The timing doesn’t have to be within the minute because waking up during your lightest sleep stage is key to not feeling groggy during the day. The </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight Sleep thermo alarm </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wakes you up within a half hour of your alarm, when you’re in your lightest sleep period. After awhile your body will automatically wake up at that time, no alarms necessary. There’s no need to be overly ambitious and set an extra early wake up time that is unrealistic. Set a wake up time that works for you. Waking up and falling asleep at the same time daily can ensure that you get the right amount of sleep needed to remain alert during the day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><b>Sleep restriction </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two automatic processes that affect our sleep: sleep pressure (sleep homeostasis) and circadian rhythm (the body’s natural clock). To improve sleep, we initially need to limit the time we spend in bed. Tossing and turning for hours isn’t helping you fall asleep. We need to allow these processes to impact our sleep schedules, but only to an extent. There’s only a certain amount of sleep needed nightly. In order to avoid oversleeping, track your sleep with a </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smart bed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to see how many hours you actually need per night.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Meal consistency </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Achieving better sleep requires consistency during the day as well. Eating at the same time every day helps to strengthen our bodies’ natural clock. Planning the timing of meals in advance helps you avoid eating meals too close to bedtime, a habit that can make it challenging to sleep.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><b>Bedtime reminder</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, it’s imperative to understand what bedtime actually means. A bedtime is not the time you start winding down; it is the time you are actually in bed by trying to fall asleep. We’re all guilty in getting so caught up in our own lives that we can skimp on sleep. In order to get the proper amount of rest (generally around 7-8 hours for the average adult), set a bedtime reminder for the same time each night. Have an alert go off about an hour before you need to be in bed. This allows you time to settle down without rushing to bed.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A consistent sleep schedule is a healthy sleep schedule. Maintaining proper sleep hygiene takes work, but consistency ultimately leads to even healthier days and nights.</span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some habits are hard to break. Take sleeping on your stomach for example. It isn’t considered the best position to sleep, but we know that any way you fall asleep and stay asleep is a good way. That’s why we’ve broken down into categories the qualities that make a mattress perfect for stomach sleepers. Keeping the following factors in mind can help stomach sleepers get an even better sleep without the struggle of breaking any habits.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Pillow</strong></p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before we talk about mattresses, it should be noted that sleeping with a pillow can make all the difference. Stomach sleepers should place put a small pillow under their abdomen to help keep their spine in alignment. Little tricks like this can help your body rest better when sleeping on your stomach.</span></p>\n<p><b>Support</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proper support is so important for stomach sleepers to help prevent pain in the lower back and spine. Your back and hips need to be supported so you’re able to fall asleep in a comfortable position on your stomach. Premium foam mattresses like </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/the-jupiter-plus?variant=43186795843\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Jupiter+ </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with 10 inches of foam are ideal for stomach sleepers because they adjust to your body’s position.</span></p>\n<p><b>Firmness</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mattress firmness is key in determining the perfect mattress for those who sleep on their stomachs. Stomach sleepers should avoid extra soft mattresses; sinking too far into the bed will be uncomfortable and can potentially lead to back problems.  If a mattress is too soft, it can also lead to misaligning your spine. You want to sleep on a mattress, not in it. A medium firm to firm mattress such as </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/the-jupiter-plus?variant=43186795843\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Jupiter+ </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(medium firmness) and </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/the-saturn-plus?variant=43186714819\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Saturn+</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (medium-firm firmness) is the best choice.</span></p>\n<p><b>Air flow</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleeping on your stomach can cause heat to become trapped, and no one wants to wake up drenched in sweat. That’s why it’s important to have a breathable mattress. Many foam mattresses tend to sleep hot, but Eight’s unique foam combinations allow for proper air flow.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pressure relief/Contour </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nobody wants to experience pain when sleeping, no matter what sleep position you prefer. When sleeping on your stomach, it’s especially important that a mattress provides pressure relief. In order to prevent spine misalignment, choose a mattress that consists partly of  contouring memory foam such as the </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/the-jupiter-plus?variant=43186795843\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Jupiter + </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that also supports the hips and back.</span></p>\n<p><b>Size</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mattress size may seem irrelevant when picking the right mattress for stomach sleepers, but it can actually play a factor in sleep. Sleepers who tend to curl up into a ball don’t need as much room as stomach sleepers, so a full size bed will likely be roomy enough for them. For stomach sleepers who tend to spread out their arms and legs, a queen or king sized bed is probably needed. If you sleep with a partner, you might also want to consider a cali king.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may sleep on your stomach, but you shouldn’t get a knot in it when it comes to picking the right mattress. With layers of support and the right firmness, The Jupiter + and The Saturn+ are both great options for stomach sleepers (not to mention they’re out of this world comfortable!).</span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Sleeping with someone else in your bed affects your sleep, both positively and negatively. There are many downfalls of sleeping with a partner, but almost all of them can be fixed with a few simple tricks.  Here are the major ways that sleeping with a partner changes the way you sleep.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Snoring</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In almost every couple, there is likely to be snorer. Snoring can keep you awake all night and negatively affect your sleep. Having your partner sleep on their side can help to prevent snoring. Additionally, propping their head up with a comfortable pillow will help to cease the snores so you both can get uninterrupted sleep.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Conflicting Temperature Preferences</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some like it hot while others prefer a cool mattress. No one should have to compromise when it comes to good sleep quality. Thankfully, there are a number of smart mattress options that allow you to adjust the temperature of each side of the bed individually. </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight’s smart mattresses</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can even heat up and cool down each side of the bed automatically during the night so you can always fall into a warm, cozy bed or a chilly cold one of that's of your liking.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Blanket Hogging</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can’t help with your partner using the last of the toilet paper and not replacing it, but there’s a simple solution for when your partner takes all of the blanket. If one of you constantly pulls the covers, it can lead to a restless, sleepless night. Each of you simply sleeping with your own blanket will make all the difference.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Tossing and Turning</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your partner is a restless sleeper who constantly tosses, turns, and occasionally kicks you in their sleep, it undoubtedly prevents you from getting a good night’s sleep. However, it may not actually be their fault. Tossing and turning could mean that the mattress is actually the issue. An old and/or uncomfortable mattress can cause both you and your partner to get a poor night’s rest. Look into replacing your mattress to stop the tossing and turning for good. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Conflicting Schedules </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chances are, your sleep schedules aren’t identical. One of you may wake up earlier than the other and consequently wake up your partner unintentionally.  To avoid this, choose a mattress with minimal to no movement transfer; <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">foam mattresses</a> like are great for this.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Strengthens relationship </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the ways that sleeping with a partner can positively affect your sleep is that it makes you feel more connected in your relationship.  Falling asleep next to a warm body each night relaxes you and makes it easier to fall asleep. Plus, who doesn’t love cuddling with someone they love and trust?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleeping with a partner completely changes the way that you sleep, but by following the above tips, you can both get a good night’s sleep every night. </span></p>",

Just as </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/the-difference-between-light-and-deep-sleep-how-much-do-you-really-need\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">light and deep sleep are different </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from one another, REM and deep sleep are two completely different sleep stages, each with defining characteristics. There are five different stages of sleep, all which contribute to your body’s </span><a href=\"https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/what-circadian-rhythm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">circadian rhythm</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or natural body clock. REM and deep sleep are stages three and four of sleep.  </span></p>\n<p><b>REM</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rapid eye movement, or REM sleep, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is the deepest sleep stage. The eyes move more rapidly in all directions during REM sleep, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s its name indicates. REM is the</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> fourth stage of sleep.</span></p>\n<b>\n<li>Time: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">REM sleep occurs approximately 90 minutes after you fall asleep. </span>\n</li>\n</b><b>\n<li>Body: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your heart beats faster, and your heartbeat will likely become irregular during REM. Aside from a change in heartbeat, the body is largely inactive during this phase of sleep. </span>\n</li>\n</b><b>\n<li>Brain: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">REM sleep is associated with intense brain activity.  This is the stage where you’ll likely experience active and vivid dreams. Sleepwalking and bedwetting incidents occur only during REM. REM sleep restores your brain and is important for your learning as well as your memory.</span>\n</li>\n</b><b>\n<li>Length: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are different periods of REM sleep, the first lasting about 10 minutes. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are about three to five periods of REM stages per night.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The length of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">REM stages increase throughout the night, and the final stage can be up to an hour. </span>\n</li>\n</b><br>\n<p><b>Deep Sleep </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deep sleep is non rapid eye movement, or NREM. There are three other NREM stages as well. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other names for this deep sleep stage are slow-wave sleep, delta sleep, and N3 since this is the third stage of sleep.</span></p>\n<b>\n<li>Time: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The body enters deep sleep anywhere from a half hour to 45 minutes after falling asleep. </span>\n</li>\n</b><b>\n<li>Body: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike REM, deep sleep is known for the changes in your body rather than your brain. Your breathing slows and your heartbeat is regular during this stage. The muscles in your body become completely relaxed, and you typically sleep through any external sleep distractions such as loud noises. Deep sleep is extremely important to overall health because it’s during this phase that the body naturally heals itself. Your body replaces cells, heals wounds, and builds muscle tissue, all while you’re sound asleep.</span>\n</li>\n</b><b>\n<li>Brain: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are almost always no dreams during this period of sleep. Although naturally unlikely, if you do wake up during deep sleep, you’ll feel groggy and disoriented at first. It is during light sleep that you wake up the easiest. Smart alarms like </span><a href=\"https://content.eightsleep.com/2017/04/11/stay-woke-eight-smart-alarm-explained/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Eight sleep tracker </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wake you up within a half hour of your alarm so you can always awake feeling refreshed. </span>\n</li>\n</b><b>\n<li>Length: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deep sleep</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">usually lasts anywhere from 1-2 hours, or 20-25% of your overall sleep.

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost all of us could use a better night’s sleep. Chances are, you’re tired even as you read this. Yet improving your sleep can seem like a daunting, complicated, and even impossible task. Luckily, there are a few basic, easy to follow tips that can help to improve sleep.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>1. Turn off the tech</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You probably know by now that watching reruns Seinfeld on your laptop or ipad isn’t good for your sleep. But what you might not know is the reason staring at screens before bed is so detrimental to your sleep. The blue light emitted from screens wakes you up, and turning on night mode doesn’t solve the problem. Watching shows or reading articles stimulates the brain and makes it harder to fall asleep. Try reading a familiar book instead.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2. Watch your diet before bed</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resisting late night snacking is hard. I’ve fallen asleep many nights cuddling a bag of pretzels in a bed full of crumbs. Yet many foods before bedtime can leave you unable to fall and stay asleep. For example, </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4330685/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cheese may cause nightmares</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and acidic and spicy foods can potentially awaken you with a stomach ache. If you find yourself craving a little snack, many fruits and nuts are perfect alternatives that don’t cause poor sleep.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3. Exercise during the day</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exercise and sleep are both part of a healthy lifestyle, but exercise can interfere with a good night’s rest if it’s done too close to bedtime. Avoid exercise at least 3 hours before you plan on to sleep. This allows your body enough time to relax before falling asleep.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>4. Improve your sleep environment</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calming colors like light blue actually have an affect on your sleep. Aside from interior design aspects, you want to ensure that your sleep environment is cool, clean, and quiet. The ideal temperature for sleep is around 60-68 degrees. You can use the Eight sleep app to automatically adjust the temperature in your room every night. Using ear plugs or a white noise machine can block out any outside noise so you can easily fall asleep. Sleep hygiene is also important when it comes to your sleep environment. You want your sheets and pillowcases to be clean to help you improve your sleep. Washing your sheets every couple of weeks is an easy way to help you sleep better.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>5. Only use your bed for sleep and sex</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At one point or another, we’ve all been guilty of eating, reading, or watching hours of television in our beds. While comfort is nice, a good night’s sleep is even better. If you do anything in your bed aside from sleeping and having sex, your brain will begin to associate other daytime activities with your bed, making it harder to fall asleep.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>6. Make sure your mattress and pillows are comfortable</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may seem obvious, but it’s an important aspect that many people don’t realize. If your bed is old and sagging, it could be the reason you’re not falling or staying asleep because you are so uncomfortable. Ideally, your mattress should support your entire body. There are many mattresses, like </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight’s mattresses</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> made with at least three layers of foam, that can help you sleep better simply by improving your comfort.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>7. Keep a consistent sleep schedule sleep</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the number one thing you can do to improve your sleep. Always go to bed around the same time every night and wake up at the same time each morning. Resisting the urge to sleep in on weekends is hard, but it becomes easier once you train your body's internal clock.  If you find yourself still struggling with insomnia, talk to your doctor for additional tips.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8. Avoid liquids an hour before bed</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hydration is important, but so is sleep. Go to the bathroom right before bed to avoid waking up in the middle of the night for bathroom breaks that can prevent you from falling back asleep. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that change doesn’t happen immediately. It takes commitment and repetition, but ultimately following these simple rules can help you sleep better. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br><br></span></p>",

To avoid disturbing their sleep (and potential grumpiness), a bed with low motion transfer is important.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Ability to sleep at different temperatures</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While no mattress can save you fights over who hogs the blankets at night,  beds with dual zone temperature capabilities like </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight smart mattresses </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can prevent those arguments over temperature preferences.  If one of you prefers to sleep cool while the other enjoys the cozy warmth of a bed, just adjust the temperature on each side of the bed to suit your preferences. You can even set individual temperatures to automatically turn on and off at certain times every day and night.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Firmness that fits that needs of both people</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Options are so important when it comes to finding the right mattress, but much like moving in with your partner, they can be overwhelming. Any good mattress brand should allow you to eliminate the low quality options.   With a trusted brand like Eight Sleep, you can </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/compare/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">choose a mattress</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the perfect mattress for you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b>Comfort </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re never going to agree on everything in relationships, but both of you can agree on wanting a comfortable bed. The most comfortable mattresses have multiple foam layers. Each Eight mattress type for example has three or more layers for maximum comfort. They are designed with layers of premium foam, durable foam, or premium foam with pocket spring coils.  All three designs provide the utmost comfort for both sleepers. An added bonus? Mattresses made of foam are better at isolating movement.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Affordability </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you and your partner on a budget but still want better sleep? Avoid the age old money arguments by buying an affordable mattress with finance options. Many retailers like Eight offer finance options so you can pay for your smart mattress over time. In fact, you don’t necessarily even need to purchase a smart mattress to reap many of the benefits of one. The Eight sleep tracker is unique in that it can fit over your existing mattress. Who said an old dog can’t learn new tricks?</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Sleep tracking </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a relationship without a little innocent competition? By using a sleep tracker, you can see who got a better sleep score each night. Most sleep trackers can only track one person’s sleep, but Eight’s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" mce-data-marked=\"1\">sleep tracking</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows you to track that of your partner’s as well. Eight’s built in piezo sensors track your individual heart and respiratory rates, time slept, and more. With the analyzed data, you can both gain valuable insight on how to improve your sleep.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/products/Eight_-_tracker_608x556_2_d609ce6c-5702-4fe3-91d8-e565a124d5d8_large.png?v=1523894339\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your bed should ultimately improve the quality of your sleep and help to make life a little easier. Smart mattresses with </span><a href=\"https://ifttt.com/eight\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IFTTT </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">integration system allow you to connect your smart bed with other smart devices in your home, such as the WeMo coffeemaker. This way, you can prevent those little arguments about whose turn it is to brew coffee. IFTTT can also connect to Amazon’s Alexa. Want to change the temperature of your side of the bed? Simply tell Alexa to raise or lower the temperature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With all of the above features combined, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pod</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is undoubtedly the best mattress for couples. Of course, Eight’s many unique characteristics make it the best mattress for single sleepers as well.</span></p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Eight’s 100 night free trial and free shipping and returns, there’s no reason not to try the best bed for you and your partner.</span>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one wants to wake up early on weekends, but ultimately for better sleep, you should be waking up and falling asleep at roughly the same time everyday. It’s not always easy to start and stick to a schedule, but there are a few sleep tricks to help you keep a consistent sleep schedule while also improving sleep hygiene.</span></p>\n<p><b>Set a bedtime</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chances are, you wake up at roughly the same time each morning for work or class. You may be tempted to stay up later on weekends and consequently wake up later, but you must pick a specific time to wake up and fall asleep. Setting an alarm each morning seems obvious, but make sure to set an alarm at night as well. Once you repeat this long enough, eventually your body’s internal clock, or circadian rhythm, will grow accustomed to the new bedtime. This will eventually lead to you falling asleep and waking up at the same time daily without even thinking about it.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/bed_calender_medium.jpeg?v=1530246227\" alt=\"\" width=\"439\" height=\"291\"></span></p>\n<p><b>Make a bedtime routine </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have a morning routine to help you wake up in the morning, and the same should go for nighttime. To improve sleep, think of some activities to do before bed that relax you and help to power down your body. Whether it’s a cup of sleepy time tea with your favorite book or doing a simple activity like a puzzle, these activities when repeated nightly signal to your brain that it’s time to sleep. </span></p>\n<p><b>Take a warm bath</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this isn’t an activity that has to be done nightly, it can be particularly useful if you’re experiencing insomnia. Soaking in a warm bath before bed relaxes your body and mind. When your body is at a warmer temperature, it can be easier to fall and stay asleep. The best part about this trick to sleep better is that you actually </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">want </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to do it. Throw in some scented bath salts, put on soothing music, and you’ll begin to unwind in no time.</span></p>\n<p><b>Meditate</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meditation can seem intimidating for beginners, but there’s really no right or wrong way to meditate. Simply taking time before bed to shut down your mind and try to put to sleep racing thoughts will make it easier to put </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">yourself </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to sleep. There are many free apps available to guide you through meditation. The Eight app actually features recorded </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t3je5-Leco&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">meditation sessions </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to listen to before falling asleep each night. </span></p>\n<p><b>Turn your lights off at the same time nightly</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look, even as adults some of us still like to leave every bright light in the house on after having watched a scary movie at night. Yet those bright lights make your body and brain more alert, making it harder to fall asleep at the same time every night. To signal to your body that it’s time for bed, dim the lights or turn them off completely at the same time every night. It can be hard to remember to do this every night, but luckily there are products that can do it for you automatically. You can connect the </span><a href=\"https://ifttt.com/eight\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight sleep tracker with Hue </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lights to automatically dim lights and/or shut them off at a certain time each night.</span></p>\n<p><b>Use a sleep tracker</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To sleep better and keep a consistent sleep schedule, there’s no better tool than a sleep tracker. Sleep trackers analyze how well you slept the night before, what time you fell asleep and woke up, and much more. Many sleep trackers like </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/eight-sleep-tracker?variant=34186577923\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight’s smart cover </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">track your sleep accurately and automatically each night. Having this information and important tips to improve your sleep schedule readily available makes it easier to keep a regular sleep schedule. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important thing to remember is that change doesn’t happen overnight. You can start by adjusting your bedtime slightly each night (10 or 20 minute intervals) until you eventually reach your desired bedtime. Maintaining a regular sleep schedule is a challenge at first, but in the end it will lead to you sleeping better and waking up feeling rested and ready for the day.</span></p>",

Thousands of people across America immediately joined us for the journey. It’s thanks to this passionate community of Eight users, that we’ve been able to track more than 2.5 million of nights of sleep in just 18 months.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But we haven’t just been listening to the data, we’ve also been listening to you. And we know that you want to know more about your sleep than just the numbers and graphs. So we used the 200 billion data points we’ve collected to build the world’s first AI-powered Sleep Coach. It’s a unique feature that analyzes and compares your personal sleep information to deliver you tailored recommendations and data points every morning. The Sleep Coach is now available for all our users for free in the mobile app. Our AI intelligence will be able to tell you things like:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Your percentage of REM sleep was 15% last night. This is lower than the healthy range of 20-25%. Try sleeping 30 minutes more tonight.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Great job! You got 7 hours and 43 minutes of sleep last night. That is 30 minutes more than your average this month.”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You sleep like a rock! This week you've tossed and turned on average 10 times per night. This is much lower than the average for people your age, which is 25 toss and turns per night.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“On average it takes you 12 minutes to fall asleep. This is significantly less than the 20 minute average for women your age.”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You are a quick riser! On average this week you got out of bed within 7 minutes of waking up. This is 15% faster than the average for people in New York City</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are passionate about using the data we collect to create and offer new innovations in sleep to our customers. Last year alone, we processed 500 terabytes of data from over 20,000 people, executed over 200,000 sleep-related smart home actions and warmed up beds for over 1 million hours. Eight continues on its path to become the largest sleep database in the world, with the expectation to track an additional 12 million nights of sleep by the end of this year. The Eight Sleep Coach is leveraging the power of this database to offer personalized sleep coaching unlike any other product currently in the market. It’s the natural next step in helping people get the best rest possible and we couldn’t be more excited to share it with you.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the best,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matteo Franceschetti<br></span>Co-Founder and CEO, Eight</p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ve probably heard about the traditional innerspring mattresses as well as the more recent memory foam beds. But now there’s a new mattress on the market: the hybrid mattress. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><b>What is a hybrid mattress?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hybrids combine the best features of innerspring and memory foam mattresses using both materials. If you don’t want to give up the feel of a traditional spring mattress but need the pressure relief and support provided by foam, a hybrid is the perfect choice. The body contouring and back support make hybrids an excellent option.</span></p>\n<p><b>What’s the real difference from other mattress types? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Innerspring mattress only contain coils, and memory foam mattresses only have layers of foam. Hybrids contain roughly the same size coils as innerspring mattresses tucked under layers of foam. Because hybrids combine the best of both worlds, the mattress cost is sometimes a bit more than air beds or innerspring mattresses. A few extra pennies is a small price to pay for a few extra hours of comfortable, relaxing sleep each night.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are the benefits? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter if you’re a stomach sleeper, back sleeper, or side sleeper, hybrid mattresses give your body the support it needs for a restful sleep. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With hybrids, you get the bounciness from the springs as well as the phenomenal support from the memory foam. You also don’t have to worry about limited options since hybrids come in a variety of sizes from multiple companies. The breathability of hybrids further adds to their comfortable nature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/products/Mars_layers_view_large.jpg?v=1524608131\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight’s hybrid mattress, </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/the-mars-plus?variant=43186834371\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Mars+,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is available in the following sizes:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Full</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Queen</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">King</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cali king</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering its affordability, breathability, and comfort, a hybrid mattress may be the perfect fit for you.

With so many options, the choice can become very stressful. Luckily, we know a lot about sleep, thanks to the over 10,000,000 hours of sleep that we’ve analyzed to understand what helps people sleep better. With this information at hand, we’ve put together the ultimate mattress buying guide to eliminate potential stress and help you in choosing a new mattress.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Before shopping:</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>When is the best time to buy a mattress? </strong></p>\n<p>The first thing to know is <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/when-to-replace-your-mattress\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when to buy a new mattress</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The answer depends on a number of factors, but on average an innerspring mattress should be replaced every 6-7 years while memory foam and latex mattress should be replaced every 7-8 years. Here are a few questions to ask yourself before buying a new mattress:</span></p>\n<p>-Are you waking up frequently during the night?</p>\n<p>-Do you wake up with aches and pains?</p>\n<p>-Do you notice your mattress sagging?</p>\n<p>-Does a bed of cacti sound more comfortable than sleeping in your own bed?</p>\n<p><strong>Is your mattress older than 6 years?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the answer to one or more of these questions is yes, then it’s probably time to buy a new mattress. Of course, an old mattress may not be the cause of your insomnia or back pain, so talk to your doctor first.</span></p>\n<p><b>What is the difference between mattress options?</b></p>\n<p>How to choose the right mattress?

If you’re on the shorter side and tend to sleep as still as a vampire in a coffin, save money by purchasing a twin size mattress.

A smart mattress will offer more features than a standard one, such as </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/pages/mattress-collections\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep tracking</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, bed temperature regulation, and even a smart alarm.

Realistically, is it only going to be you sleeping on this mattress, or will a significant other be sleeping in it a majority of the time? Do your kids often crawl into bed with you? These are all factors to consider as everyone’s mattress needs are different. If you will be sharing the bed with others, choosing a foam, latex, or memory foam mattress like </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/the-jupiter-plus?variant=43186795843\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Jupiter </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mattress will minimize motion transfer for a more restful sleep.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/jupiterplusbed_large.jpg?v=1521223976\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p>\n<h2><b>During Shopping:</b></h2>\n<p><b>Don’t rush </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’ve decided on the type of mattress that is right for your sleep needs, you may want to purchase it immediately. But don’t jump into your new bed so fast. Chances are, that “limited time sale” isn’t so limited; there will likely be another sale in a month or so. Comparing and negotiating prices can be exhausting, so let the experts do it for you.

Testing a mattress allows you to check for proper support and comfort. Realistically, you won’t be able to know if a mattress is right for you by laying on it in a department store for 5 minutes. Many brands like Eight offer </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/pages/the-100-night-trial\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free 100 night trials</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Buying </span><b>online</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tends to be cheaper, but you often don’t get as much information and support.

Do the shower trick</b></p>\n<ol start=\"3\"></ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There's a </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/the-90-second-energy-hack-you-need-to-try\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">90-second trick</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you do to boost your energy in the mornings. At the end of your shower, simply blast yourself with cold water for 30 seconds, followed by hot water for 30 seconds, and then finish with cold water for a final 30 seconds. The rapid change in temperature will increase blood flow and stimulate the body and mind. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>4. Fatten up your coffee</b></p>\n<ol start=\"4\"></ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of relying on that third cup of coffee, or that extra shot of espresso, consider adding healthy fats to your morning cup of coffee to give yourself a boost. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you depend on coffee to function, mix your coffee with 2 teaspoons of coconut oil or butter. Adding healthy fats to your coffee will make the caffeine metabolize slowly and work throughout the day. As a result, you'll stay alert for longer. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<b>5. Exercise </b><br>\n<ol start=\"5\"></ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may sound like a daunting task in the early hours of the day, but </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exercising in the morning is the best way to wake yourself up. Working out boosts endorphins, which gives you more energy and puts you in a better mood. You'll also jumpstart your metabolism and burn more calories. Not only will you feel more energized, but you'll be healthier too. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<b>6. Drink a lemon elixir </b><br>\n<ol start=\"6\"></ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several health benefits to drinking warm lemon water in the morning. First, it flushes out toxins and aids the digestive system. Second, lemon is rich in nutrients like calcium, potassium, and vitamin C. Most importantly, it hydrates and oxygenates the body. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<b>7. Eat a banana</b><br>\n<ol start=\"7\"></ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bananas are an excellent morning staple because the fruit's combination of complex carbs, natural sugar, amino acids, and brain-boosting vitamins will give you a quick energy boost. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perfect to eat by itself or add to your breakfast.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<b>8. Jam out </b><br>\n<ol start=\"8\"></ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Play upbeat music as you're getting ready or commuting to work. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decide on a playlist or choose a list of songs that make you feel lively and excited. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The energizing tunes will pump you up and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">make </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feel ready for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the day.  </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<b>9. Get some sunlight</b><br>\n<ol start=\"9\"></ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Light, especially bright light from the sun, signals the body that it's time to wake up. As soon as you get up, open your blinds and let in the natural light</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to start feeling less fatigue.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<b>10. Smell essential oils </b><br>\n<ol start=\"10\"></ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aromatherapy can significantly reduce your grogginess. Peppermint and eucalyptus scents can make you feel more alert, focused, and stimulated in the morning. The smell of rosemary can jumpstart your brain, giving you more mental and physical energy. Citrus can reduce stress and boost the body's production of serotonin. In fact, </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16095639\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">studies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have shown that sniffing the skin of an orange can increase alertness and reduce anxiety. </span> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you dread waking up each morning, remember that you have the opportunity to set yourself up for success by just adding a few extra steps to your morning routine. There are so many alternatives to turn to when you find yourself needing a push in those early hours of the day. And, believe it or not, these added steps might prove to be more helpful than that extra shot (or two) of espresso.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what are you waiting for? Follow these 10 hacks to help you feel energized and rejuvenated every morning. Begin by conquering one morning, and pretty soon you will be able to conquer them all.</span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Waking up is hard, and waking up without an alarm can be even harder for some. Nobody likes to be jolted awake from a loud, ringing noise, but many of us depend on our alarms to get us up in the morning. What if we told you there's a way to train yourself to wake up without a jarring alarm? The key to doing this is training your body and circadian rhythm to adjust to the morning naturally.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Consistency is key </strong></p>\r\n<p>To stop using an alarm, you need to maintain a consistent sleep schedule. This means going to bed and waking up at the same time everyday. Following a specific schedule will set and regulate your internal body clock. You can start by waking up every morning at 7 AM using an alarm. Your body will gradually adjust to this time and you'll soon find yourself waking up on your own, before your alarm.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Establish rituals</strong></p>\r\n<p>To help you stick to a sleep-wake routine, we suggest creating a bedtime ritual that gets you ready for sleep and forming morning habits that get you excited about waking up. Your pre-bed routine should promote good sleep hygiene. About an hour before bed, dim the lights and switch your phone to night mode. You can also practice relaxation techniques like meditation or a warm bath to destress and wind down. Since we're talking about waking up, the morning routine is most important. Have you ever noticed how easy it is to wake up on the morning of a vacation or big event you're looking forward to? This is because your brain knows that you need to be energized. The best way to trick your brain into thinking this all the time, is to schedule exciting things to do in the morning. Go for a run, sign up for your favorite yoga class, or make a delicious smoothie. If you do something fun or active every morning, you'll start to get used to waking up early. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Open your blinds</strong></p>\r\n<p>The sun is your natural alarm clock, so use it to your advantage. Open your blinds a crack to let the sun in. Light plays a huge role in our circadian and signals the brain that it's time to get up. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Set one just in case </strong></p>\r\n<p>﻿If you're afraid of sleeping in, set an alarm as a backup. It's always better to be safe than sorry (or in this case - late). Our favorite type of alarm to use is a smart alarm because it wakes you up in your lightest stage of sleep. If you set your alarm at 7 AM, it may go off up to 30 minutes earlier depending on your sleep cycle. You'll feel better waking up with the smart alarm because you won't feel groggy. This way, you'll have more energy to go about your day. </p>",

            "body_html": "<p>We all want to sleep better, but there's one part of sleep that's even more crucial to our overall health - deep sleep. </p>\n<p>Deep sleep is the elusive stage of sleep when your brain waves are at their lowest frequency, your muscles relax, and your breathing slows. Also known as delta wave sleep, it comes at the end of NREM sleep. Deep sleep is so important because it's the most restorative part of the night. During this time, energy levels recharge, body tissues are repaired, muscles receive more blood supply, and the pituitary gland releases human growth hormone. Basically, you need deep sleep to maintain, repair, and rejuvenate your body and brain. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/the-difference-between-light-and-deep-sleep-how-much-do-you-really-need\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">amount of deep sleep</a> you need varies with age, but spending at least 20% of the night in deep sleep is a good goal.  When a person is in deep sleep, they barely move and are difficult to wake up. Sleepers in deep sleep are less apt to wake in response to external stimuli and won't be disrupted during their slumber. If you get more deep sleep, you'll toss and turn less and likely feel more well-rested in the morning. </p>\n<p>Since this stage of sleep is so mysterious, there is little research on how to get deeper sleep. However, the best way to get more deep sleep is to sleep better and more soundly. Here are some ways you can set your sleep up for success. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>1. Regulate Bedroom Temperature </strong></p>\n<p>If you're too hot or too cold during the night, you'll probably have difficulty falling or staying asleep. This will cause you to toss and turn a lot and may interrupt your deep sleep. The ideal bedroom temperature for optimal sleep is 60-67 degrees. A cooler bedroom will facilitate sleep by lowering the body temperature, which happens at the onset of sleep. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2. Eliminate Distractions </strong></p>\n<p>Another reason for restlessness is external distractions like noise and light. Keep your phone on silent and away from your bed to avoid being awoken by notifications. In addition, you should try to sleep in a dark room. Blackout shades will help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. If it's noisy outside your bedroom window, try listening to relaxing sounds or using a white noise machine during the night to offset those loud noises.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3. Avoid Alcohol Or Caffeine </strong></p>\n<p>The number one reason for tossing and turning at night is alcohol or caffeine. Drinking booze or coffee close to bedtime messes with your sleep. Caffeine may keep you up at night while alcohol will disrupt your slumber. As the alcohol wears off during the second part of the night, people usually wake up and deep sleep is cut short. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3. Get Comfy </strong></p>\n<p>Being comfortable is the best way to have a good, full night's sleep. There are a number of ways to get comfy at night, but we recommend finding a mattress you love first. The <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">right mattress</a> will do wonders for your sleep. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

            "created_at": "2018-02-13T15:59:29-05:00",
            "body_html": "<p>With almost 60% of Eight users sharing a bed, it's no wonder our smart mattresses were designed with couples in mind. Despite what some of us may think, sharing a bed with a partner does not cause significant sleep disturbances. Although some people may wake up due to snoring or a partner's toss and turns, the reality is that sleeping next to someone isn't a factor in bad sleep. Our data found that those who shared a bed had almost the same sleep score as those who slept alone. In fact, people who shared a bed had a slightly higher average score (71.24) than solo sleepers (70.48). </p>\r\n<p>If your partner is disrupting your sleep quality, there are two easy ways to resolve the issue (without kicking him or her to the couch): </p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Upgrade your mattress</strong> </p>\r\n<p>You need a foam mattress that minimizes motion transfer. This way you won't feel your partner move as he or she switches sleep positions. </p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Check the temperature </strong></p>\r\n<p>It can be tough to agree on the perfect bed temperature. The Eight Smart Mattress solves the biggest issue when sharing a bed by offering dual-zone temperature control. One person can warm up their bed while the other can keep it as is. In addition, it's important to set your bedroom thermostat to a cool temperature of 60-67 degrees. This is the ideal temperature for good sleep. </p>\r\n<p>Some sleep experts are now saying the sharing the bed with someone improves sleep quality. A <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/5915750/the-benefits-of-sharing-your-bed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2009 study</a> found that women in long-term stable relationships fell asleep quicker and woke up less during the night compared to single women. The researchers also hypothesized that shared sleep in healthy relationships may lower levels of cortisol, a stress hormone and boost oxytocin, the love-hormone that eases anxiety. If you share a bed, it's also recommended to have sex right before bed - it may be the key to a good night's sleep. Oxytocin, which is released during an orgasm, <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dream-catcher/201108/oxytocin-sleep-and-dreams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">influences</a> sleep processes and dreams. </p>\r\n<p>If you're single, don't fret! Good sleep is still possible for you. Many people still find sharing a bed too be annoying and uncomfortable. In a survey by the University of Leeds and Silentnight, 29% of people said their partner was an obstacle to their sleep. And poor sleep could hurt everything -- from your mood to your weight. Likewise, 60% of couples polled by <em>The Today Show </em><a href=\"https://www.today.com/health/defense-sleeping-solo-60-percent-you-prefer-your-own-bed-6C10885410?utm_source=huffingtonpost.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=pubexchange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported</a> sleeping better alone. </p>\r\n<p>Since there seems to be data supporting single sleepers and couples, it's really up to you. Both types of sleeping are great, as long as you are comfortable. </p>\r\n<p> </p>",

            "body_html": "<p>No matter how tired we feel, we've all had that one night where we just can't fall asleep. The reasons why we occasionally struggle to fall asleep vary - from too much coffee during the day to anxiety and stress. </p>\r\n<p>In order to fall asleep quickly, you need to be in the right state of mind and body. This means calm and controlled breaths as well as a clear mind. Simple breathing exercises can combat anxiety and help with insomnia. Harvard trained doctor, Andrew Weil, believes the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3067526/Can-t-sleep-4-7-8-breathing-technique-claims-help-nod-60-SECONDS.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">4-7-8 trick</a> will help you fall asleep in 60 seconds. That's right - 60 SECONDS! </p>\r\n<p><strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong></p>\r\n<p>The method is described as a natural tranquilizer that reduces tension in the body and promotes relaxation. For it to work, you need to breathe in counts of 4, 7, and 8. Doing so, your lungs and brain will properly fill with oxygen, which helps catalyze a good night's sleep. </p>\r\n<p><strong>HOW YOU DO IT</strong></p>\r\n<p>1. Exhale completely through your mouth making a 'whoosh' sound</p>\r\n<p>2. Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds</p>\r\n<p>3. Hold your breath for 7 seconds</p>\r\n<p>4. Exhale through your mouth for 8 seconds, making another 'whoosh' sound </p>\r\n<p>5. Repeat 3 times </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlDSsHuxLM97yso/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p>The technique is based on an ancient Indian practice called pranayama, which means \"regulation of breath.\" If it doesn't work at first, don't worry! It will take a some time to master the rhythm. It also helps to not focus too much on the end goal. If you put too much pressure on yourself to fall asleep fast, your mind will be unable to relax. </p>\r\n<p><em>Have you tried this 4-7-8 trick before? Does it work for you?</em> </p>",

In fact, sleep devices from smart mattresses to white noise machines are becoming increasingly popular in the market. As our society struggles to get enough sleep year after year, technology seems to be the only answer. It has improved almost every aspect of our lives, so why not leverage it to help us get a good night's sleep. </p>\n<p>With so many gadgets available today, we've selected our 10 favorite that actually work to improve sleep quality. </p>\n<p>1. <a href=\"https://www.eightsleep.com\">Eight Smart Mattress </a></p>\n<p>Our sensor-based mattress is engineered to help you sleep better and wake up refreshed. It monitors your sleep patterns through the night and gives you actionable suggestions on what you can do to improve the quality of your sleep. It also features dual-zone bed warming and supreme comfort to help you relax at night. Plus, use the smart alarm to wake you up in your lightest stage of sleep. </p>\n<p>2. <a href=\"getawair.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Awair</a></p>\n<p>Getting a good night's sleep requires a good sleep environment. This means eliminating distractions such as noise and light, but also taking into account air quality. Awair is a smart device that tracks toxins and chemicals in your air to help you stay healthy and breathe easy. It also gives you a <a href=\"http://blog.getawair.com/introducing-awairs-sleep-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sleep report</a> every morning that analyzes your bedroom and tells you how your air affects your quality of sleep. Indoor air pollution can negatively impact sleep quality, which is why you need to clean up your air to sleep well. </p>\n<p><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/Screen_Shot_2018-02-09_at_3.04.28_PM_large.png?v=1518206774\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p>\n<p>3. <a href=\"https://www2.meethue.com/en-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Philips Hue White &amp; Color Starter Kit</a></p>\n<p>Smart lights are a great investment because your sleep cycle is dictated by light. With these Philips Hue lights, you can create a setting that mimics the sunset and gradually dims down as you drift off to sleep. You can also switch your lights to a relaxing orange color at night to signal your brain that it's time to wind down. In the morning, you can trigger a wake up light which will naturally wake you up with lights. </p>\n<p>4. <a href=\"https://www.calm.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Calm </a></p>\n<p>Calm is an app focused on mindfulness and meditation, both of which will help you sleep better. Doing a little bit of guided meditation at night can calm anxiety and promote deep sleep. It's especially great for people who often have trouble falling asleep. </p>\n<p>5. <a href=\"https://www.mydodow.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dodow </a></p>\n<p>This new digital sleep lamp was developed by insomniacs to help you drift off fast. It uses a hypnotizing blue light to coordinate and slow down your breaths to stimulate your body's natural resting state. </p>\n<p>6.  <a href=\"https://www.smartnora.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Smart Nora</a></p>\n<p>Snoring can interrupt sleep and cause a lot of problems when sharing a bed. Smart Nora is a revolutionary product that detects snoring throughout the night. You insert into your pillow and it will gently adjust your pillow when you start snoring. This will stimulate the throat muscles, allowing for natural breathing to resume. It'll help the snorer and the partner sleep soundly during the night. </p>\n<p>7. <a href=\"https://nest.com/thermostats/nest-learning-thermostat/overview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nest Thermostat</a> </p>\n<p>One of the major causes of toss and turns at night is improper bedroom temperature. The ideal temperature for optimal sleep is 60-67 degrees Fahrenheit. Keeping the room too hot or too cold can disrupt sleep. A smart thermostat like Nest will help you regulate your bedroom so it stays at the perfect sleep-inducing temperature. </p>\n<p>8. <a href=\"http://www.sleepwithremee.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Remee</a></p>\n<p>If you're looking for a sleep mask that enhances REM sleep, Remee will do just that. During REM sleep, blood flow decreases to the brain and redirects itself towards the muscles, allowing the body and mind to properly rest and recover. This eye cover uses customizable light signals to increase dream recall. </p>\n<p>9. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/09/somnox-s-robotic-pillow-is-designed-to-snuggle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Somnox</a></p>\n<p>Although we haven't tried this, we're very intrigued by the sleep robot that claims it'll help you sleep. This pillow-like device is designed to simulate breathing and play soothing music to help you fall asleep. </p>\n<p>10. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/URPOWER-Essential-Humidifier-Adjustable-Waterless/dp/B00Y2CQRZY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Urpower Essential Oil Diffuser </a></p>\n<p>Aromatherapy shouldn't be overlooked when trying to sleep better. Placing an essential oil diffuser in your bedroom is a great solution for sinus congestion, insomnia, or stress. We like the lavender scent because it relaxes the body and calms the mind. Using it 30 minutes before bed may help you drift off faster. </p>\n<h6><em>** This article has been written in collaboration with <a href=\"getawair.com\">AWAIR</a>.

            "body_html": "<p>We've all struggled with a bad night of sleep before. Tossing and turning all night can leave us feeling seriously lethargic and anxious the next day. However, a sleepless night doesn't have to set you off track. You'll be surprised at how well you can function if you use these strategies to power through your day. </p>\n<p><strong>1. Stay optimistic</strong> </p>\n<p>Don't underestimate human resilience. One night of poor sleep isn't catastrophic. If you keep the right attitude, you may find your focus and energy levels are consistent with your normal days. Working yourself up over a rough night will just drain your energy more. It's important not to stress about your night because obsessing over not sleeping can lead to more trouble sleeping the next night. </p>\n<p><strong>2. Take it easy </strong></p>\n<p>With your energy already compromised, it makes sense to take it easy the next day. Skip your planned evening workout, and spend your night unwinding before bed. If you don't get enough sleep, your workouts will be significantly less effective. Restorative sleep is needed to repair and build muscle tissues. Gentle exercise is fine, but don't exert yourself too much. Try doing some yoga or light exercise in the morning to promote blood circulation and increase alertness. </p>\n<p><strong>3. Let there be light </strong></p>\n<p>Get exposed to as much bright light as possible, especially right after waking up. Morning light energizes us and improves mood by boosting serotonin levels. It also helps regulate our circadian rhythm, which will contribute to better sleep in the future. When there's little or no sunlight in the AM, use <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mf_95086/how-i-use-light-to-hack-my-energy-f1670e48dd55\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">artificial light</a> during the daytime. </p>\n<p><strong>4. Stick to a healthy diet </strong></p>\n<p>Even though you'll be tempted to reach for a sweet pastry and coffee in the morning, sugar and caffeine will only provide a short fix. You should also avoid large meals and simple carbohydrates like pasta for lunch. These foods will make you more likely to crash later on. Try eating protein-rich foods like nuts and lean meats to keep you energy levels up. Remember to stay hydrated and drink a lot of water during the day as well. </p>\n<p><strong>5. Go outside</strong></p>\n<p>Tiredness peaks from 1 pm - 3 pm. If you can't squeeze in a 20-minute power nap during this time, get some fresh air. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494409000838\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Research</a> shows that spending time outside increases energy in 90% of people. </p>\n<p>Sleepless nights happen to the best of us, but we can overcome their negative effects. Remember, it's just one day we have to get through. Bed is only a few hours away. Go to sleep slightly earlier the following night and you'll feel totally rejuvenated the next day. </p>\n<p> </p>",

            "body_html": "<p>We spend at least a third of our lives sleeping, so it's important we make our sleep count. A good night's sleep is just as important as a healthy diet and regular exercise in maintaining good health. Several studies show that poor sleep can negatively effect the brain and body from impaired memory and cognitive function to increased risk of heart disease or weight gain. </p>\r\n<p>If you want to lead a healthy life, quality sleep should be made a priority. Since everyone sleeps, it shouldn't be that hard to sleep well. Here are 8 evidence-based tips to sleep better at night. </p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Go into night mode</strong></p>\r\n<p>Light, especially the harsh blue light emitted from screens, can disrupt sleep. Put your devices in night mode and try to limit your use of phones, tablets, and laptops in the evening. The blue light impacts your circadian rhythm by stimulating the brain and tricking the brain into thinking it's still daytime. </p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Unwind before bed</strong></p>\r\n<p>Many people have trouble falling asleep when they have a lot on their minds. Stress and anxiety will keep you up at night, so it's important to unwind before bed. Do some breathing or meditation exercises to calm you down. You should try and stop working at 30 minutes to an hour before going to sleep.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Write everything down</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you are worrying about work, remove those thoughts from your head by writing them down. According to <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-47677-001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research from Baylor University</a>, people who wrote down their to-do lists fro the next day were able to fall asleep faster. </p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Optimize your bedroom environment</strong></p>\r\n<p>In order to get the best sleep of your life, you need to create an ideal bedroom environment. Your bedroom should be quiet, dark, and organized to get a good night's sleep. Noise, external lights, and clutter have all been shown to affect sleep quality. One <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21243655\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study</a> found that around 50% of participants noticed better sleep when reductions in noise and lighting were introduced.  </p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Keep your bedroom cool </strong></p>\r\n<p>One of the primary reasons for tossing and turning at night is temperature regulation. The idea temperature of sleep is fairly cool, between <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8022726?ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">60-68 degrees</a>. Temperatures in this range help facilitate the decrease in core body temperature that initiates sleepiness. </p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Exercise regularly </strong></p>\r\n<p>For those who have trouble falling asleep, your solution may be found at the gym. Regular exercise during the day is a great way to ensure a good night's sleep. One <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8980207\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study</a> found that exercise nearly halved the amount of time it took to fall asleep and helped participants sleep 41 minutes longer at night. </p>\r\n<p><strong>7. Keep a consistent schedule </strong></p>\r\n<p>This is one of the most important rules to follow if you want to sleep better. Waking up at the same time everyday, even on weekends, will synchronize your circadian rhythm and help you wake up feeling refreshed and well-rested. Maintaining a regular schedule, specifically wake up time, will ensure that all the proper hormones are being released at the right time. </p>\r\n<p><strong>8. Get a comfortable mattress</strong></p>\r\n<p>Comfort is key when sleeping, and the right mattress can do wonders for you! You need a mattress that will provide the perfect amount of support for you back and neck. <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/pages/mattress-collections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Eight Smart Mattress</a> was designed to align the neck and spine and cradle the body in all the right places. Remember that mattresses sag with time, so if you've had your mattress for more than 8 years - it's time for an upgrade. </p>",

            "created_at": "2017-12-22T13:51:14-05:00",
            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Here at Eight, we’re a small team with big plans for the future. In order to optimize sleep, we need to maximize our productivity. This means we need to be efficient, effective, and ambitious when setting and achieving our goals. As a startup, we need to move fast and execute well. We’ve grown exponentially in the past year, and can attest our growth to our hard working team at Eight HQ.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Eight, we believe good sleep is a mean to better health, happiness, energy, and productivity. Today’s post is going to focus on the latter. These are our 5 favorite tips for increasing workplace productivity.</span><b></b></span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>1. The Two Priority Rule</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">This rule was invented by the CEO of Eight, Matteo Franceschetti, and we all use it in our daily work routine. The right way to prioritize is to work on only 2 tasks, projects, or goals per day. Once you understand what’s most important, focus only on that. Don’t get distracted with smaller tasks and learn how to say no to requests. The way you choose these priorities is by determining which ones will bring the most improvement and value to the company. You shouldn’t try to do more than two, because a third is not manageable. Peter Thiel is famous for pushing each of his team members to focus only on one priority at a time. Matteo believes we can stretch that to two.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>2. Follow A Schedule</strong></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong></strong></span></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In order to be productive, you need to be organized. Following a schedule is the best way to stay on top of all the things you need to do. At Eight, we use Google Calendar to keep track of meetings, deadlines, and reminders. Many of us also block off a chunk of time for a specific task. Our Growth Lead does market research every Friday from 3-5 PM. Our Social Media Manager monitors Facebook notifications every morning at 11 AM. And our Engineering Team plans weekly sprints every Tuesday at 10:30 AM. Having these tasks on the calendar helps us maintain focus throughout the workweek. Following a schedule is important in all aspects of life, not just work. The world’s best CEOs claim a consistent schedule is the key to success. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day will leave you feeling refreshed each day, even on Monday mornings. Forming a daily routine will help you maximize your waking hours, develop discipline, and make you feel better.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\"></span></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>3. Make To-Do Lists</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">You can’t be productive without making to-do lists. Create a daily or weekly to-do list and check the list every day to make sure you’re doing everything you need to be doing. And remember, you don’t need to have a million things on your to-do list. Keep it simple and prioritize your tasks. Try to be strategic about your energy. Don’t waste energy on small, menial tasks. Apply your energy to the two most important tasks that move your business forward. Also, be cognizant as to when you write these to-do lists. Alexandra Zatarain, Co-Founder and CMO of Eight, writes out her list every Sunday afternoon. She says writing it out on Sunday reduces the stress and anxiety of Monday morning. It also helps start the day with clarity. You’ll know exactly which item you need to complete by 10 AM the next morning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>4. Manage Your Time</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A highly-efficient way to manage time is to make a chart based on urgency and importance. This is called the time management matrix, and it’s divided into four sections (Important + Urgent, Important + Not Urgent, Not Important + Urgent, Not Important + Not Urgent). The idea is to focus on quadrant 2. This is where you’ll add the most value to your company. It requires more high-level thinking and strategizing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/Screen_Shot_2017-12-22_at_12.12.31_PM_grande.png?v=1513968549\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\"><b>5. Sleep Well</b></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last but certainly not least, pay attention to your sleep. Insufficient sleep can compromise output and hold you back professionally, resulting in reduced efficiency and overall poor productivity. When you don’t sleep enough, you’ll get distracted more easily, you’ll make more mistakes, and your memory will falter. A </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21886353\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard research study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that, for the average worker, insomnia leads to the loss of 11.3 days’ worth of productivity each calendar year. In order to get better sleep and perform at your best, you need to identify a healthy sleep routine. This means first creating an ideal sleeping environment - </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/pages/mattress-collections\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quality mattress</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, cool bedroom temperature, and little to night. Once your environment is conducive for sleep, try to go to bed earlier and limit the use of electronics at night. Finally, don’t forget to wake up at the same time every morning - even on weekends. This will keep you well-rested and energized throughout the work week.</span></span></p>\n</div>",

But this isn’t your normal morning shower. When we take hot showers (as most of us do), our body temperature rises. An increase in body temperature actually creates a bedtime effect, relaxing the body and preparing it for sleep. Luckily, there’s a 90-second trick that you can do to reverse this effect. At the end of your shower, simply blast yourself with cold water for 30 seconds, followed by hot water for 30 seconds, and then finish with cold water for a final 30 seconds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rapid change in temperature will open up the capillaries, increase blood flow, and stimulate the body and mind. Experts believe this hack can boost your energy and keep you alert all day long. Our Founder &amp; CEO, <strong>Matteo Franceschetti</strong>, does it every day and swears by it.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"I started doing it a few months ago, and it's now part of my morning routine. The switch from hot to cold helps me feel more energized the minute I step out of the shower. </span></em><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It's so easy to do and you'll feel the effects immediately. Since I exercise in the morning, this cold water hack also helps my muscles recover. It's a win-win for me. </span></em><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you combine this with the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mf_95086/all-you-need-is-8-minutes-to-feel-more-energized-in-the-morning-31c23389094b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8 minute work out</a> before showering, benefits will be even more substantial.\" </span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matteo also does a quick work out in the morning to boost his energy. Combining his workout with the shower hack is the ultimate energizing routine. He continued, </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"If you have a chance, I notice that having a sauna in the morning after working out and then taking the cold shower will help you even more. The key thing is expose the body to temperature shocks.\"</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This shower technique is just a DIY-version of hot and cold hydrotherapy, which has been used for thousands of years for its natural healing and stress-relieving powers. Alternating between hot and cold temperatures increases blood circulation and detoxes the body. There are several benefits to taking cold showers, and we have scientific research to prove it.</span></p>\n<p><b>Reduces stress </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A </span><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0891584994900302\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that those who regularly swim in cold water were able to adapt and tolerate stress. The shock of the cold water hardens the body overtime and helps it respond healthily to stressful situations.</span></p>\n<p><b>Strengthens immune system</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17999770\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that taking daily cold showers increases the number of disease-fighting white blood cells. In order to warm up, the body speeds up its metabolic rate, thus activating the immune system. A </span><a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161749\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2016 study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> also found that hot-to-cold showering reduced the amount of times people stayed home sick. Say hello to health!</span></p>\n<p><b>Improves blood circulation </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When exposed to cold water, your arteries and veins constrict. This temporary tightening allows blood to flow at a higher pressure, which is great for cardiovascular health. The increased blood circulation decreases inflammation and swelling, which is why professional athletes use ice baths to help their muscles recover after a workout. </span></p>\n<p><b>Burns fat</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scientists have found that shivering from cold showers triggers the production of </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19357407\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brown fat</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which works to keep you warm by burning calories.</span></p>\n<p><b>Battles depression </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cold showers could be a potential treatment for depression. </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17993252\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that exposure to cold activates the sympathetic nervous system and increases endorphins, which cold produce an anti-depressive effect. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Although cold showers aren’t the most enjoyable, they reap so many positive benefits. And we’re not asking you to take an entirely cold shower. All you need is a few seconds of cold at the end. Remember, it’s 30 seconds of cold - 30 seconds of hot - 30 seconds of cold. Try it out for a week, and see how energized you feel during the day.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mf_95086/how-i-use-light-to-hack-my-energy-f1670e48dd55\">Want more ways to feel energized throughout the day?

            "body_html": "<p>Well, kind of. </p>\n<p>But your Thanksgiving turkey isn't the only food to blame for your post-dinner nap. An ongoing myth is that the tryptophan in turkey is what makes you sleepy. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid needed for the body to produce serotonin. And serotonin is used to make melatonin, which is the hormone that helps you sleep. Although turkey and sleep are somewhat connected, the bird does not contain enough tryptophan to induce sleep, and it actually has <a href=\"http://www.newswise.com/articles/the-myth-about-l-trypophan-in-turkey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">less tryptophan</a> than other poultry like chicken or even eggs. </p>\n<p>The \"food coma\" we experience after Thanksgiving is likely due to the large quantities of food consumed in general. That includes turkey, but also stuffing, mashed potatoes, booze, and pie. In 2016, our Eight users slept 29 more minutes than average after Thanksgiving. This year, we only slept 9 more minutes than usual, averaging at 6 hours at 31 minutes. We also got 19.5% of deep sleep, which is in the healthy range. </p>\n<p>People tend to overindulge during the holidays, and a typical Thanksgiving plate can be well over 2,000 calories. High-carb, high-fat, and high-sugar foods (like sweet potato casserole or pumpkin pie) trigger a neural response that tells the body to slow down. Furthermore, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15488646\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">researchers</a> found that a group of brain cells called orexin neurons are very sensitive to glucose levels, which spike after a big meal. Those neurons produce a protein, orexin, which moderates wakefulness. </p>\n<p>As the quantity of food increases, so does the amount of insulin released during digestion. Insulin then increases the amount of serotonin and melatonin in the body, which are the two primary chemicals associated with drowsiness. </p>\n<p>The best way to avoid the Thanksgiving food coma is to eat earlier (around 5 PM), have a healthy breakfast on Thursday morning, and control your portion size. Remember, there's always room for leftovers! </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media0.giphy.com/media/ukli2aMsEpQkw/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>",

            "body_html": "<p>We all know how important a good night's sleep is for our well-being, but sometimes life gets in the way. Sleeping in on the weekends, work, stress, and traveling can impact our sleep cycle and throw it off its normal rhythm. Going days or weeks without a consistent sleep schedule can be detrimental to your health. When your circadian rhythm is out of sync, you may find it difficult to fall asleep and wake up at the right times. But like any clock, your circadian clock can be reset as well. </p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><strong>Here's a guide on how to fix your sleep schedule following a time change:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/TimeChnage_1024x1024.jpg?v=1509741863\" style=\"float: none;\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p>Following the guide above is one way to fix your sleep schedule. In fact, it can take 3 days up to one week to adjust to a new time. Beside changing your sleep and wake times slightly, you can also try these tips. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>1. Turn on the lights</strong></p>\n<p>Your biological clock is mainly controlled by the daily cycles of lightness and darkness, and manipulating light exposure may help reset your clock. Turn on the lights right when you wake up. This is super helpful in the fall and winter because it's typically still dark in the mornings. We recommend syncing your Phillips Hue to your alarm so you wake up with sunrise simulating lights. You should start dimming the lights as the sun sets, and try to keep your bedroom as dark as possible. This means lights from screens should be reduced or fully eliminated. </p>\n<p><strong>2. Fast for 12-16 hours</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sleep.med.harvard.edu/news/229/Harvard+study+finds+fasting+resets+circadian+clock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Research from Harvard</a> suggested that not eating for about 12-16 hours can quickly reboot the sleep-wake cycle. This is because our bodies also run on a \"food clock,\" which takes over when we are hungry. If you are a jet lag, this technique is extremely effective. By fasting for 12-16 hours, you can trick your body that it's time to sleep. When you break the fast, your body will think it's morning. For non-jetlag disturbances, you could still try this fast. Eat an early dinner (around 4 PM), and then avoid eating until breakfast (8 AM). Once your sleep is back on schedule, stick to normal meal times. </p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><strong>3. Stay consistent </strong></p>\n<p>A consistent sleep schedule is the best way to achieve a good night's sleep. This means you need to go to sleep and wake up at the same time everyday, including weekends. When you sleep in on Saturday and Sunday, it'll be much harder to wake up for work on Monday. Waking up late on the weekend produces something called \"social jet lag\" and is associated with poorer health, worse mood, and fatigue. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> Want to change your sleep habits for the better? A healthy sleep schedule is the first step. </p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Have you ever dreamed that you were falling and jolted awake right before you were about to hit the ground? Probably. </p>\r\n<p>Turns out, falling is the most common element in dreams. Since falling dreams produce an uneasy feeling, we're going to say it's a nightmare. Nightmares are bad dreams that awake you from deep sleep. They occur most often during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and could be explained as the unconscious manifestation of your everyday fears and anxieties. Although dream analysis is subjective, many people believe falling indicates a loss of control. When people feel overwhelmed in their lives, they may experience nightmares about falling. We surveyed 1,000 Eight users and found that 42% of them have had a falling nightmare. The second most common nightmare amongst Eight users was being attacked at 41% followed by being trapped (34%), death (32%), showing up late to work (29%). </p>\r\n<p>Our survey also supported a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090128104535.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2009 study</a> showing that women are more likely to report having nightmares than their male counterparts. We found that women recall their dreams upon awakening 17x more often than men. Women also admitted to having infidelity nightmares, and had them 38x more often than men. Since women tend to pay more attention to their feelings, they are more likely to carry their feelings into bed and subsequently dream about them. Whether women experience nightmares more than men or just report them more frequently is yet to be determined. </p>\r\n<p>Although nightmares can be scary, they didn't seem to affect the quality of one's sleep. Sleep scores remained fairly consistent between those who recall their nightmares and those who do not. </p>\r\n<p>Check out the rest of our findings below: </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/Nightmares_infographic-01_2048x2048.jpg?v=1509394126\" style=\"float: none;\"></p>",

But sleep is an important part of living healthy as well, and sleep tracking can help further improve our health when combined with an active lifestyle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What sleep trackers can tell you about your health: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-if you’re sleeping too much or too little</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-if you have health issues that interrupt your sleep</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-can help determine why you feel fatigue or exhaustion during the day</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-how your daily activities affect sleep</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-if you're at an increased risk for heart disease and/or depression</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Living healthy requires being aware of the importance of your sleep, and sleep trackers show you the quality of your sleep in detail, from how many hours you sleep nightly to your respiratory and heart rate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep deprivation can literally </span><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2011/03/sleep-is-more-important-than-f\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">kill you, and it can do so faster than food deprivation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Many people do not realize they are not getting enough sleep, but a sleep tracker reveals a severe lack of sleep before it turns into a major health issue. Tracking your sleep can tell you how long it takes you to fall asleep each night. If it takes you a mere few minutes every night, you are likely sleep deprived. A lack of sleep has also been found to weaken your immune system and lead to depression. You can use the information from sleep tracking to help avoid health problems and improve your sleep.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversely, oversleeping is also a health issue that sleep tracking can detect. Regularly sleeping for more than 9 hours each night poses health risks just like sleep deprivation does, such as a </span><a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/guide/physical-side-effects-oversleeping#1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">higher risk of heart disease and depression</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A sleep tracker can detect oversleeping so you can seek help from a sleep professional and live healthy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep tracking can also help to detect other sleep issues like sleep apnea. By using a sleep tracker, you can talk to a doctor and seek treatment sooner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, poor sleep leads to an inability to fully concentrate on tasks during the day. No one wants to mess up that work presentation or fail that final exam. More importantly, a good night’s rest gives us the energy we need to exercise during the day, another key element to overall health.  Not sure the cause behind your poor sleep? Sleep trackers like the </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/eight-sleep-tracker?variant=34186577923\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight bed technology</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help determine possible reasons behind a lack of or interrupted sleep.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Eight app connects your waking hours with those spent asleep so you can see how activities like drinking caffeine or exercising before bed affect your sleep and make any necessary changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From telling us the right amount of sleep we need each night to detecting sleep issues, sleep trackers can provide us the information needed to help us live our healthiest and most well rested lives.

            "body_html": "<p>Even though we gain an extra hour of sleep this weekend, it doesn't necessarily mean we'll feel more rested come Monday morning. </p>\n<p>Daylight Savings Time officially ends at 2 AM on November 6th. This means we'll turn the clocks back one hour. \"Falling back\" seems great, but even a seemingly small one-hour shift can affect sleep for up to a week. The time change disrupts the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, and people may experience trouble falling asleep and increased nighttime awakenings. Dr. Yvonne Harrison of Liverpool John Moores University in England <a href=\"http://www.smrv-journal.com/article/S1087-0792(12)00114-1/abstract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">concluded</a> that short sleepers (those who log under 7.5 hours a night) and early risers have the most trouble adjusting to the new schedule. This is because 7 AM becomes 6 AM, which feels even earlier for early birds. </p>\n<p>Not only are the mornings different, but so are the nights. The days become shorter and it starts to get dark out by 5 PM. When it comes to sleep, light is very important. Your body's internal clock is dictated by light. You're wired to feel sleepier when it's dark and feel alert when it's light out. When it's dark out, your body starts to produce melatonin, which is associated with the onset of sleep. When it gets dark while you're still at work, you may start to feel sluggish due to melatonin production. Sunlight, in particular, is very important in the getting a good night's sleep. Vitamin D is crucial for serotonin production, and serotonin is involved with many functions of our sleep-wake cycles. Our main source of vitamin D is sunlight, which is in shorter supply during the fall and winter months. <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201105/sunlight-sugar-and-serotonin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Research</a> has also shown that lack of sunlight can increase feelings of depression and fatigue. In serious cases, the darker days and colder weather could cause Seasonal Affective Disorder, which has been linked to reduced sleep efficiency and less slow-wave sleep. In order to boost mood, try to get as much sunlight as possible. Take a 15-minute break in the afternoon and go for a walk outside. If you can't leave your desk, try sitting by a window. Studies have shown that sitting by the window increases productivity.</p>\n<p>The time change may make you feel tired, but it isn't all bad for sleep. In fact, the end of daylight savings is the seasonal signifier that colder weather is on the horizon. Cooler air actually helps you sleep better. On those chilly autumn nights, you'll probably be more comfortable in bed than on those hot and humid summer nights. Sleep experts say that cooler temperatures promote the body's natural deep sleep process. </p>\n<p>Although DST impacts sleep, the effects are not permanent. The good thing about our bodies is that they learn to adjust. However, if you'd like the speed up the adjustment process, you can try these tips. </p>\n<p>1. Go to sleep a little earlier a few days leading up to the clock change </p>\n<p>2. Use the <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/stay-woke-the-eight-smart-alarm-explained-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eight Smart Alarm</a> to wake you up at your lightest stage of sleep, so you don't feel groggy</p>\n<p>3. Maximize deep sleep by creating a quiet and relaxing bedroom environment </p>\n<p>4. Exercise in the morning to get in the habit of waking up and working out</p>\n<p>When the clocks fall back this weekend, you have the opportunity to reboot your sleep cycle. Think of it as a clean start. In order to get the best night's sleep, you need to stick to a consistent sleep-wake schedule. If your previous schedule was all over the place, this is your time to make a change and get the sleep you need (and deserve).   </p>\n<p> </p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By now, you probably know that sleep tracking allows you to learn about your sleep patterns. You may wonder why you should invest in a sleep tracker when you already know how many hours per night you sleep. In reality, sleep tracking reveals a lot more about your sleep than simply telling you how many hours you slept.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good night’s sleep isn’t just measured by how long you sleep. Sure, you can sleep eight hours, but those eight hours need to be well spent. It’s quality over quantity. There are numerous factors that contribute to a good night, such as the amount of deep sleep you had and the number of toss and turns. In order to see the benefits of deep sleep, you need to spend at least 20% of your night in deep sleep. During this time, your body repairs itself. Your organs detoxicate, your kidneys clean your blood, and your body rebuilds muscle tissues. As for toss and turns, you should aim for less than 7 per night, which signifies you had an non-disruptive and restful slumber.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tracking your sleep can also show you what amount of sleep is necessary each night for you to be well rested. The ideal bedtime is not the same for everyone, but through analyzing data of how long it takes you to fall asleep at certain times, a sleep tracker reveals what time is best for you to retire to bed. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, one of the biggest benefits of sleep trackers is that they can reveal potential sleep issues like sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome after multiple tosses and turns throughout the night are detected. You can seek help from a doctor sooner than you might without sleep tracking. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep tracking can also reveal whether your sleep position is preventing you from getting a good night’s sleep. You can learn if sleeping on your side is actually not the best for your rest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Convinced you sleep better with a cuddle buddy? With sleep tracking, you can discover how sleeping with a partner or furry friend affects your sleep. Data can be tracked for you and a partner using the Eight sleep tracker. You can also learn what room and bed temperature is ideal for your sleep.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep tracking also shows you how long it takes you to fall asleep each night. If you find that it takes a significant amount of time, you can investigate potential causes such as too much screen time or caffeine before bed. </span></p>\r\n<p>You can uncover the potential source of your morning moodiness as well. Sleep trackers show what stage of sleep you awoke from; if you awoke during a period of deep sleep, you’re more likely to be groggy. Apps like the Eight app feature a smart alarm that connects to your bed technology in the sleep tracker and waking you up during your lightest phase of sleep.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With so much to discover about your sleep, using a sleep tracker is a decision you should sleep on, literally. Check out Eight’s unique sleep tracker </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/eight-sleep-tracker?variant=34186577923\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and learn more about your sleep. </span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each year brings new types of “smart” technology. Smart means something different for each product, and it can sometimes be confusing to keep track of just what makes the new product so smart. Smart mattresses are without a doubt an improvement from standard mattresses, but what exactly are the differences?</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standard Mattress</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A standard mattress is what you grew up sleeping on. Standard mattresses can be foam, spring, or a hybrid of both; they contain no technology. A typical mattress is not personalized to your sleep habits and is designed simply as a place to sleep.  A normal mattress offers no way of knowing if and how your sleep changes. If you want to track you sleep on a standard mattress, you either have to cuddle up next to your smartphone or wear an uncomfortable sleep tracking bracelet to bed.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smart Mattress</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A smart mattress, also known as a smart bed, has technology that tracks your sleep. They offer many benefits that standard mattresses lack. For example, smart mattresses automatically track your sleeping habits every night without you having to charge a device or sleep with another piece of technology. This sleep tracking provides you with the data you need for sleep improvement. Tracking your sleep tells you how many hours of sleep each night is ideal for you. This helps lead to better overall health since the right amount of sleep is crucial to function at the best of our abilities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smart mattresses manage aspects of your sleep that standard mattresses cannot. For example, the temperature of your smart mattress can be set so you climb into a warm, cozy bed each night. Want to lower the lights an hour before bed? Smart mattresses can also connect to your other smart devices such as Hue lighting, Nest thermostats, and smart coffeemakers. When connected with an app, your smart mattress can also sense what stage of sleep you are in and wake you up during your lightest stage within a half hour of your alarm. These integrations help lead to a smoother sleep experience overall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, the difference between a smart mattress and a standard mattress is the ability of smart mattresses to treat sleep as an experience unique to each individual. Smart mattresses help to improve the quality of your sleep by providing you with nightly data without you having to do a thing besides open an app. Switching to a smart mattress is the smart choice for better sleep.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/products/Eight-Smart-Mattress-phone_large.jpg?v=1502223521\" alt=\"\"></span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From cars to phones, the things we use most when we’re awake are being made smarter to help make our lives easier. Considering we spend about a third of our life asleep, it makes sense that our beds should be smarter too. There are a few different types of beds that utilize technology, but what exactly is a smart mattress?</span></p>\n<p style=\"float: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The function of smart mattresses is to essentially to help you sleep better. A smart mattress leverages technology to understand what you need to get your best rest. The first thing a smart mattress does is track your sleep seamlessly, eliminating the need to wear a clunky bracelet to bed or sleep with your phone. All smart mattresses require to track your sleep is for you to rest. Smart beds collect sleep data without you having to do a thing. To access the data, you simply open an app and discover your personal sleep information. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By helping you understand your sleep, smart mattresses will guide you to better sleep and as a consequence improve health.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, not all smart mattresses are the same. Certain mattresses are smarter than others. Some self proclaimed smart mattresses for example only adjust the pressure of the mattress, while other smart mattresses can only raise or lower certain areas of the bed for an adjusted form. Then there are mattresses that do more than that, using real time data to adjust your environment to fit your needs while you are sleeping and make sure nothing interrupts a good REM.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight is the first truly smart mattress that can adjust the temperature of the bed on each side before you even get in bed, detect when you are in light sleep to wake you up, and connect with other smart devices to make life easier for you. Eight’s technology consists of piezo sensors in a cover that goes over your bed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So why should you try a smart mattress? Personalizing sleep is the next big step in sleep improvement. For decades, beds have been made with a “one type fits all” mentality. In reality, we all have different sleep needs. A smart mattress will tell you when your sleep changes for better or worse so you can rest well and awake refreshed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A true smart mattress approaches sleep as an experience and connects your waking hours with hours spent asleep through technology.  Through viewing this data on an app, you can figure out how certain activities may affect sleep and ultimately sleep smarter. </span></p>",

Luckily, sleep trackers can help. From improved sleep to better health, there are plenty of reasons you should be tracking your slumber.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest benefits of using a sleep tracker is that it will track your individual patterns to understand your lifestyle and sleep.  You can personalize homes, phones, and clothes, so why not personalize your sleep?  Sleep tracking can show you how to get your best sleep. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amount of hours needed per night is </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/are-you-wasting-your-life-how-many-hours-of-sleep-we-really-need\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not the same for everyone</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Tracking your sleep shows you the ideal number of hours you personally need each night. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not sure the cause of your sleep problems? Another advantage of sleep tracking is discovering the reasons behind sleep related issues. Using a sleep tracker lets you skip going to a sleep lab and discover your sleep data in the comfort of your own bed. The data is accurate and readily available. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A further benefit of sleep tracking is that it can lead to positive change. Humans are more likely to change habits when they track them. Writing about your sleep in a sleep journal is time consuming. Luckily, sleep trackers show you your sleep patterns so you can improve your sleep.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tracking your sleep also lets you wake up at the right time. A number of sleep trackers, like the bed technology Eight uses, wake you up with a smart alarm during your lightest period of sleep and within a half hour of when you set your alarm. You avoid waking up groggy and in a bad mood and are instead rested and ready from the very start. This allows you to be more productive throughout the day. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep trackers can also connect your daytime activities to sleep so you learn what is best for you to get a good night’s rest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, sleep tracking provides you with objective facts. </span><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11233074_Insomniacs%27_Perception_of_Wake_Instead_of_Sleep\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has shown that some people over or underestimate the amount of sleep they actually get a night; this can be harmful to their overall health. </span></p>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tracking your sleep is part of a healthy lifestyle.

However, the data received from using a sleep tracker can actually help you discover a lot and lead to better sleep.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those of us who suffer from not being able to fall or stay asleep can find out possible reasons for this thanks to sleep tracking. Going to sleep and waking up at roughly the same time every day is an essential part of a good night’s sleep.Tracking your sleep may help you realize that you go to sleep and wake up at different times every day.  You can use this information and adjust your schedule to rest better.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tracking your sleep can also tell you how many times you toss and turn during the night. If the number is high every night, you may realize that your mattress is to blame. Mattresses can sag over time and become less comfortable, and a sleep tracker is a great way to discover when it’s time to purchase a new one.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep tracking goes beyond sleep. Sleep trackers often help people realize how their lifestyle affects their sleep. For example, you can discover how many times you woke up during the night and what percentage of sleep was spent in deep sleep. Using the Eight app connected with Eight’s sleep tracker, you are able to view how your daytime activities like exercise and drinking affect sleep. Sleep tracking can show how your bedtime brandy helps you fall asleep quicker but leads to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/you-booze-you-don-t-snooze-how-alcohol-affects-your-sleep\">a more disruptive sleep.</a></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bed technology like Eight’s Sleep Tracker that conveniently fits over your mattress lets you discover more information about your sleep than you could ever dream of. </span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p>There is a ton of evidence out there linking insufficient sleep to poor quality of life. Lack of sleep can have a negative impact on mood, cognition, and brain function. It can also lead to an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and even cancer.</p>\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10549-012-2144-z/fulltext.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2012 study</a> found women who chronically lacked sleep developed more aggressive breast cancers. For the general public, these findings suggested there may be a link between long term sleep deprivation and the development of more aggressive tumors. To put it simply, not getting enough sleep puts women at a greater risk of the disease. The importance of sleep in breast cancer patients was further supported when researchers from Michigan State University revealed that the sleep-inducing hormone, melatonin, seems to stop the growth of breast cancer tumors. The report, published in the <a href=\"http://www.impactjournals.com/Genes&amp;Cancer/index.php?abs=107\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Genes &amp; Cancer</a> journal, found that treating cancer with melatonin significantly decreased the number and size of tumors compared with the control group of tumors that didn't get melatonin. </p>\r\n<p>Getting sufficient sleep is clearly important to live a healthy life, but a <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/bjc/journal/v116/n9/full/bjc201785a.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recent study</a> says getting too much sleep may be tied to worse breast cancer survival odds. According to the British Journal of Cancer, women with breast cancer who sleep at least nine hours were 46% more likely to die from their tumors than patients who got just eight hours of sleep. </p>\r\n<p>Although more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between sleep and mortality and survival rates, sleep-related complaints are extremely common in women with breast cancer. In fact, more than <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21825267\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">60% of women</a> with either metastatic or non-metastatic disease are diagnosed with insomnia. This prevalence exceeds both healthy adults and women with other cancers. </p>\r\n<p>Breast cancer treatments are usually the culprit of these sleep disturbances. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can disrupt sleep-wake cycles and interfere with sleep. A one-year, longitudinal study showed that both subjective and objective measures of sleep got worse with each cycle of chemo in 80% of women with breast cancer. The distressing side effects of radiation and chemo such as nausea, depression, and pain can interfere with the quality of one's sleep. </p>\r\n<p>In order to improve sleep and quality of life in breast cancer patients, experts recommend behavioral interventions and alternative therapies. Yoga, light exercise, meditation, and structured cognitive behavioral therapy have all been effective in improving overall well-being in breast cancer survivors. </p>",

Staying healthy is key to a long life. It’s no secret that good sleep habits help us achieve good health, and sleep tracking can be a useful tool to living a longer life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are three major types of sleep trackers: ones you wear on your wrist, phone apps, and sleep trackers that you put in the bed. Tracking sleep using a device worn on your wrist can be annoying; no one wants to have to charge </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">another </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">device. The sleep tracking phone apps require you to sleep with your phone, and that is neither comfortable nor safe.  Luckily, sleep trackers that are built into the mattress cover on your bed are safe and easy to use. Bed sleep trackers use advanced bed technology to monitor your health, both asleep and awake. </span></p>\n<p>Sleep tracking features allow you to view a number of factors that are important for health. You can discover your time slept, how much you tossed and turned during the night, your respiratory and heart rate, your sleep schedule, and sleep stages. If you find that your respiratory and/or heart rate is abnormally high or low for example, you can talk to your doctor right away. Without nightly sleep tracking, you may not realize unhealthy changes in your body as quickly.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lack of sleep has been associated with obesity and clinical depression, two things that can literally kill you. When we are able to track our sleep, we stand a greater chance of avoiding certain health risks. You’ve heard the saying “knowledge is power”, but in this case knowledge is better health. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An essential part of a healthy, long life is a lack of stress. </span><a href=\"https://heartmdinstitute.com/stress-relief/what-stress-can-do-to-your-body/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chronic stress can lead to heart disease</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which can ultimately lead to a young death.

            "body_html": "<p>For most of us, Labor Day Weekend marks the end of summer. It's when Starbucks starts selling Pumpkin Spice Lattes and sweater weather falls upon us. Although we're sad to see summer come to a close, our sleep could get a lot better. </p>\r\n<p>Humidity and heat during the summertime makes it harder to get a good night's sleep. People toss and turn more and often have trouble falling asleep due to warmer bedroom temperatures. In the fall, nights are a lot cooler and bedroom temperatures become much more comfortable. Scientists say<span> that cooler air supports the body’s natural deep sleep process. The ideal room temperature for rest is between 60-70 degrees, depending on personal preference, body temperature, and bedding</span><span>. </span></p>\r\n<p>The new season also means shorter days. As it starts to get darker earlier, we may feel more tired. When the sun sets, our bodies begin producing melatonin - the sleep inducing hormone. Leaving work when it's dark outside makes people sleepier, and much more likely to go home to their beds instead of staying out late at a rooftop bar. </p>\r\n<p>As the leaves change, so do our sleep habits. Longer nights and snuggle weather make us naturally crave sleep. There's nothing cozier than sleeping under warm blankets or on <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/pages/features\">heated beds</a>. The fall also means heartier meals like chili, potatoes, stews, pumpkins, and root vegetables. These carbohydrate-dense foods allow us to nod off quicker. However, feeling sleepier is not necessarily a good thing. Gloomier weather and less sunlight causes increased fatigue and lower energy levels. In order to combat this, people need to get their blood pumping. Staying active through exercise is the best way to help transition the body from summer to fall.</p>\r\n<p>Sunny days, which are prevalent in the summer, actually help you fall asleep at night. Although the days are shorter in the fall, you should still make an effort to expose yourself to sunlight. Go for a morning walk, keep the blinds open, and sit by the window at work. Light activates the wake part of the sleep-wake cycle. Morning light helps to regulate your circadian rhythm and keep on track. When daylight savings ends on November 5th, make sure to get as much sunlight as possible during the following days. This will help your body adjust to the shorter days. </p>",

Over time, it starts to depreciate as the weight of your body becomes too much for it to carry. Usually, indentations become permanent, causing the mattress to break down even faster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purchasing a new mattress can be an exciting time, and many people fall in love with their mattresses right away, but it can also be a time of some trepidation. Difficulties can present themselves when you’re trying to get comfortable with something that is new. You may think that the mattress doesn’t exactly conform to your body. It may take a while before you become comfortable and acquainted with your new mattress. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this case, there are several things that you might want to review when trying to break in your new mattress. </span></p>\n<br>\n<h2><b><i>WHAT TO EXPECT FROM A NEW MATTRESS.</i></b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(1) It may take some time for your body to become familiar with the new materials that comprise the mattress. Your </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/your-old-mattress-is-ruining-your-sleep\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">old mattress</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has conformed to your body type, so it might be a while for your body to consider the new mattress to be as comfortable as the old mattress. It can take </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">up to eight weeks</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for your body to adjust to the new surroundings. Some people are allergic to some types of materials, so it may be wise to check what are the materials that were used to manufacture the mattress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(2) On occasion, you might be privy to a </span><a href=\"http://thechalkboardmag.com/new-mattress-smell-off-gassing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smell that comes with the new mattress</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is normal after taking off the protective coating that covers it after being sent from the factory. Smells that were at the location where it was being manufactured will become trapped when it is sealed. These smells will stay in side of the packaging until they are released when opened. This doesn’t mean that the mattress is ruined. The smell is not harmful to people. The odors should dissipate over time, allowing the person to use the mattress without the annoying smells.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(3) When you receive the new mattress, you may notice that there are several scuffs, blemishes, or loose threads that are seen. This is normal from the manufacturing of process and doesn’t mean that it is damaged. These small complications are very common and don't change the durability, the comfort, or the validity of the warranty that comes with the mattress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(4) You may experience the mattress as being too thick or tough because of it being new. Modern mattresses that are created today are manufactured to be thicker than those built in the past. You may notice that your bed is further from the floor than it was before. Your older sheets may not fit, and you may have to purchase others to accommodate the new size. Many times, the headboards and the footboard can be adjusted in order to change the size of the bed to match the new mattress. You can purchase </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/products/all-organic-sheets?variant=34044136067\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deep-pocket sheets</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to fit your new mattress to make it more comfortable and to match your tastes better.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(5) One thing to remember after purchasing your new mattress is to give it a firm and sturdy support. If you don’t have a strong foundation that supports the mattress, then it will start to sag and degrade causing your warranty to become invalid. </span><a href=\"https://getbestmattress.com/best-mattress-size/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">King and queen sized mattresses</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> require that you have a bed frame with a middle support. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are but a few things that might happen while trying to incorporate a new mattress into your sleeping regimen. You must keep in mind that several obstacles my present themselves while you become accustomed to the change. Remember that all mattresses that are manufactured in the United States are hand-made and may have several errors that creep into their manufacturing process. You may see possible skipped threads, or errors with the seams, as well as fabric scuffs and other issues. This doesn’t destroy or hinder the performance of the mattress, or devalue the warranty that comes with it. </span></p>\n<br>\n<h2><b><i>HOW WILL YOU FEEL DURING THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS?</i></b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After inspecting and setting up your new mattress, you are now ready to sleep on it and to see how it will feel for your body. There will be many kinds of differences that you will associate with the new mattress. Here are some of the complications that you might experience while resting on it for the first few nights. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(1) You may find that you are waking up sore from a night’s rest on the new mattress. This is the most common complaint that is made by people. Your body has become to the way that the old mattress has been comforting your body, but in the wrong ways because it is old and needed to be replaced. Now, your body is finally being supported in the correct manner and now it must become familiar with the correct way of resting on a mattress. After some time with resting on the mattress, your body will feel less sore, leaving you with an adequate night of sleep and comfort.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(2) You might expect to find </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/5-surprising-foods-that-will-help-you-sleep\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">falling to sleep difficult</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and distracting but eventually, this will stop as your body becomes more familiar with the nuances of having a new mattress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(3) You may </span><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/why-we-toss-and-turn-at-night\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">toss and turn at night</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as you try to rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(4) Waking up in the middle of the night might be an issue as well, but it will subside in several days as you become more accustomed to your bed with a new mattress. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amount of time that it will take for you to become used to the fact of having a new bed will not take long as your body begins to rest better. It is different for many people and the length of time can vary. It can take a few days for some, and for others, they discover that it takes longer. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the end, you should eventually be able to rest on your new mattress as you finally head off into a good night sleep. It is suggested to try the mattress for at least 30 days in order to truly assess whether it is the best mattress for you.</span></p>",

            "created_at": "2017-08-18T12:25:33-04:00",
            "body_html": "<p>A rare astronomical event occurred on August 21, 2017. It was the first time in nearly 100 years that a solar eclipse was visible in totality from coast to coast in the United States. </p>\n<p>A solar eclipse is when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, thereby totally obscuring the sun. As the moon blocks the sunlight, day seems to turn into night. During this time, the sky goes dark, temperature drops and solar energy decreases. </p>\n<p>There is a lot of speculation, but not a lot of science on the effect of solar eclipses on sleep - simply due to the fact that there aren't many to study. However, there is plenty of research on lunar cycles and sleep. A report in <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(13)00754-9?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982213007549%3Fshowall%3Dtrue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Current Biology</a> noted that full moons tend to disrupt sleep. According to the study, people sleep about 20 minutes less and get 30% less deep sleep around the full moon. This is probably due to the reductions in melatonin, a light-sensitive hormone that controls the natural sleep-wake cycle. </p>\n<p>Full moons cause the night to be brighter, whereas solar eclipses cause the day to be darker. So how exactly did this phenomenon affect our sleep? </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2017/08/35887436474_84d258661e_o-800x663.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; float: none;\"></p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><em>This photo shows the last glimmers of sunlight as the moon heads toward totality. Photo by NASA/Aubrey Gemignani.</em></p>\n<p>Using the sleep data from over 10,000 people, we studied the night of the August 2017 Great American Solar Eclipse compared to the rest of the summer. We found that Americans had lower quality sleep on the night of August 21st. On average, people went to sleep much later, about 1 hour 23 minutes later to be precise. They also tossed and turned 32% more on the eclipse night compared to the past 90 days. In numerical terms, people tossed and turned 23 times compared to the summer average of 17. We also saw a dip in our user's sleep scores, with the average being 58 compared to 61. One of the most startling differences we noticed was the amount of deep sleep in Wyoming, which was a state in the path of totality. Those in Wyoming got 29% more deep sleep on the night of eclipse. Their sleep score, however, was still lower than the past 90 days. </p>\n<p>Based on this data, we can surmise that the daytime darkness, or the hype surrounding the eclipse, had some effect on sleep. Whether it was physical or psychological is something that requires further scientific research. </p>\n<p>Although there are no direct physical effects of a solar eclipse on sleep, there are a number of strange things that do happen. For many animals, the onset of darkness signals their nighttime behaviors. Nocturnal animals like owls and bats come out to hunt and birds get confused. During the 2001 solar eclipse over Africa, most birds fell silent as the sun disappeared. Other bizarre observations include a bunch of whales and dolphins surfacing, captive squirrels becoming agitated, butterflies disappearing from the sky, geese not feeding, and chickens huddling together. </p>\n<p>A total solar eclipse like this one will not cross continental US from coast to coast again until 2045. By then, who knows what kind of research capabilities we'll have? Here's hoping the effect of solar eclipses on sleep will be studied once more. </p>",

            "body_html": "<p>According to a new study, sleeping too much could be the cause of your nightmares. </p>\r\n<p>Researchers from the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-017-1408-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">University of Oxford</a> surveyed 846 adults and found that those reporting more than nine hours of sleep a night were 45% more likely to have nightmares than those who slept for a shorter amount of time. Nightmares, just like dreams, occur during our deepest stage of sleep: REM. Longer sleep allows for more late-night REM sleep, which increases the opportunity for those nightmares to occur.</p>\r\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the study also listed higher levels of worry, stress, and paranoia as contributing factors to nightmares. </p>\r\n<p>Nightmares occur for several reasons, but this study is the first to mention longer sleep duration as a cause. The common explanation of nightmares is that negative emotions and anxieties from the day run through your brain at night causing dreams to turn scary.  Eating right before bed - which increases your metabolism and makes the brain more active - as well as medications are other factors linked to nightmares. </p>\r\n<p>As any survey-based study, there are a few caveats. For one, the sample size was not fully representative of the entire population. Those who responded to the survey were most white and female and an average age of 44. Another shortcoming was the fact that this study was based on self-reported data, which isn't always reliable. </p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, the findings indicate that nightmares may not be wholly accountable to negative emotions, PTSD symptoms, and stressful life events. Further research is definitely needed to assess the association between sleep duration and nightmares. </p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Soldiers, in particular, get way less. In the military, there's no such thing as sleeping in and resting. Between rigorous training schedules and long work hours, many soldiers survive on less than five hours of sleep, and under extreme circumstances some may stay awake for days. </p>\r\n<p>Luckily, the U.S. military is beginning to adopt a new attitude on sleep. The Performance Triad is a 2012 initiative that focuses on the three pillars of good health: sleep, activity, and nutrition. Sleep is vital in achieving optimal physical, mental, and emotional health. Inadequate sleep impairs many skills that are essential to a soldier's mission, such as physical performance, alertness, and the ability to perform complex cognitive tasks. In a <a href=\"https://fas.org/irp/agency/dod/jason/human.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">report</a> commissioned by the Pentagon's Office of Defense Research and Engineering, the \"most immediate human performance factor in military effectiveness is degradation of performance under stressful conditions, particularly sleep deprivation.\" </p>\r\n<p>Sleep deprivation is a deep-rooted part of soldier culture, and progress won't happen over night. One <a href=\"http://www.aasmnet.org/articles.aspx?id=3615\">study</a> found that 85% of active military personnel had some type of sleep disorder. Additionally, o<span>ut of the 2 million Americans who've served in combat since September 11, 2001, 54% have insomnia.</span> The RAND corporation also found that 48.5% of service members reported poor sleep quality, qualified as a \"clinically significant sleep disturbance. Sleep deprivation is very damaging, and its effects go beyond the field.</p>\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n<p>Soldiers who suffer from insomnia have a greater chance of developing depression, suffering from PTSD, and committing suicide. And recent evidence suggests the increased incidence of sleep disturbances in redeployed military personnel is a predictor of PTSD. An increasing number of soldiers are being diagnosed with sleep problems, most likely due to trauma, anxiety, and the short sleep duration. </p>\r\n<p>The importance of sleep in the military is not an understatement. Performance without sufficient sleep may have devastating consequences. We must pay more attention to soldiers' sleep in order to protect their health both on and off duty. For this reason, we at Eight are giving a special discount to all active and retired military personnel. </p>\r\n<p>Get 10% off all our sleep products and enjoy better sleep today. </p>\r\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/pages/militarydiscount\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MILITARY DISCOUNT</a></p>",

Emergency responders like EMTs, Police Officers, and Firefighters could be on the clock when most people are in bed. In fact, they could be working 16 to 24-hour shifts. </p>\r\n<p>In March 2015, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration referenced a <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/tired-ems-workers-prescription-danger-roads-experts/story?id=31876777\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study</a> in which 50% of EMS workers surveyed suffered from fatigue, and consequently were more likely to be injured on the job, commit medical errors, or perform a safety-compromising behavior. </p>\r\n<p>Sleep deprivation impairs judgement, decreases reaction speed, and reduces memory retention. Additionally, prolonged periods of sleep deprivation magnify these effects and produce cognitive impairment similar to a blood alcohol level of 0.1%, well over the legal limit. Skills that are essential to emergency responders like critical thinking, rapid response, fine motor function, and multi-tasking are all affected by fatigue. </p>\r\n<p>Every year, the amount of emergency calls are increasing, with the projection for 2020 being 36 million calls nationwide. There's a high demand for emergency responders, and not enough time for sleep. </p>\r\n<p>One of the most effective ways to refresh a fatigued worker is to permit (and prioritize) short power naps at work. A nap of just 20-45 minutes is enough to improve alertness and reduce potential errors. EMS workers should be treated just like pilots. NASA's Fatigue Countermeasures Program listed the importance of naps in improving mental alertness. Pilots who were allowed to take a short nap improved their performance by 34% and their alertness by 54%. </p>\r\n<p>Another way to decrease sleep deprivation amongst emergency workers is to limit the number of consecutive shifts an employee can work. Everyone needs to rest, including people who work in a crisis. At Eight, we have designed the very best products for sleep.

The UK study found that people who slept an average of six hours a night had a larger waist circumference than those who slept nine hours a night.

When you don't sleep, you're hurting your body's ability to perform to the best of it's ability. In addition, you might unknowingly be adding a few pounds. There is strong evidence suggesting that sleep deprivation could lead to weight gain. For one, when you're sleep deprived, you have poorer decision making skills and less self control, resulting in bad food choices. Another reason is that lack of sleep disrupts hormones that regulate appetite, which can induce hunger and trigger unhealthy nighttime cravings. </p>\r\n<p>This study builds on existing research that shows the impact of insufficient sleep on our bodies. And the consequences come down to the numbers. Just as you can change your diet, you need to change you sleep habits in order to be healthy.

            "created_at": "2017-07-25T16:11:09-04:00",
            "body_html": "<p>Sleep may seem as simple as closing your eyes, but there is a lot that goes on behind those eyelids. The sleep-wake cycle is regulated by two separate biological mechanisms: sleep-wake homeostasis and circadian rhythm. This two-process model was first posited by the Swiss sleep researcher Alexander Borbély in the early 1980s. </p>\r\n<p>1. <strong>Sleep-wake Homeostasis</strong>, or Process S, is the accumulation of sleep-inducing substances in the brain. It's an internal biochemical system that operates like a timer, generating homeostatic sleep drive or the need to sleep after a certain amount of time awake. It effectively reminds the body that it needs to sleep - so the longer you've been awake, the stronger your desire for sleep becomes. </p>\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n<p>2. <strong>The circadian process</strong>, also known as Process C, is the regulation of the body's internal biological processes and alertness levels. This is what controls the timing of sleep and it coordinates the light-dark cycle of day and night. Your circadian rhythm is what regulates your body's sleep patterns, feeding patterns, core body temperature, brain wave activity, and hormone production over a 24-hour period.</p>\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n<p>To break it down simply, <span>the first process causes a </span><em><strong>pressure</strong> </em><span>to fall asleep, whilst the second dictates the</span><em> <strong>daily rhythm</strong></em><span> of sleep.</span></p>\r\n<p>These two processes work together to create a balanced sleep-wake cycle. While you're sleeping, the homeostatic sleep drive rapidly dissipates and circadian-regulated melatonin is produced. By the early morning, melatonin secretion stops and the circadian alerting system begins. This will overcome the existing sleep drive, thus triggering the body to wake up.  </p>\r\n<p>Homeostatic sleep drive typically increases throughout the day, which is why you get tired as the day goes on. However, it is countered and moderated by the circadian drive for arousal, at least until the night when the circadian clock begins producing melatonin again. When this happens, the \"sleep gate\" opens and the urge to sleep increases significantly. </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/sleep-homeostasis_grande.gif?v=1501014680\" style=\"float: none;\"></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Image Source: <a href=\"https://sleepjunkies.com/science/two-process-model/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sleep Junkies</a></p>\r\n<p>Getting a good night's sleep depends on these two processes working seamlessly together.  If these two processes aren't aligned, you won’t be able to sleep well, no matter how tired you feel. Climbing into bed before Process S says you're ready will guarantee a night of tossing and turning. Listen to your body and you'll sleep soundly! </p>\r\n<p>Even though this model dominates the scientific understanding of sleep regulation, external factors such as work schedules, genetics, food, stress, and exercise also influence sleep times. </p>",

            "body_html": "<p>There's nothing worse than waking up on a gloomy day. It's dark, rainy, and hardly conducive for going to work. </p>\n<p>The reason for your morning struggle is, in fact, the weather. Our bodies rely on sunlight to signal our internal clocks that it's time to wake up. Without bright morning sunlight to kickstart our day, we'll feel lethargic and down. It's not the rain per se making us want to stay in bed and snuggle under the covers, but the lack of light we're reacting to. </p>\n<p>Light inhibits the secretion of melatonin, the hormone that makes us sleepy. When there are overcast skies, our bodies will continue producing melatonin, even after our alarm clocks go off. Serotonin, which enhances mood, is also produced in the presence of sunlight. When there is less sunlight, serotonin production is reduced. </p>\n<p>There are other non-hormonal reasons why we're extra tired on rainy days. For one, the earthy smell of rain is soothing. The musky scent is produced when a substance called geosmin interacts with plant oils present in the soil. The oils are secreted during dry periods to prevent the seeds from germination. Another relaxing smell is that of ozone, which appears after a thunderstorm. Ozone is a molecule made of three oxygen atoms, and is generated when lightening interacts with the air. This aroma resembles that of freshly laundered sheets, which can induce sleep. </p>\n<p>Rain sounds are also quite comforting. The rhythmic pitter-patter of rainfall is considered \"pink noise,\" which is a category of relaxing background noise. Pink noise has been shown to improve the quality of sleep by muffling out outside noises and decreasing brain activity. </p>\n<p>Rain definitely makes it harder to wake up, but it doesn't have to keep you sleepy all day. Try eating a healthy breakfast to energize you or hit the gym, if you can. Another way to combat the negative effects of rainy mornings is to open the blinds and give your home as much exposure as possible to natural light. If you know it's going to rain the night before, sleep with your curtains or blinds open to allow any bit of light to seep through.  </p>",

            "body_html": "<p>As you get older, you need less sleep - and there's an evolutionary reason for this. </p>\r\n<p>New research published in the <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/284/1858/20170967\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Proceedings of the Royals Society B</a>, suggests that our sleep patterns reflect the hunter-gatherer behavior of our ancestors. The idea, known as the \"sentinel hypothesis,\" is that in dangerous situations, a group of people (or animals) only goes to sleep if sentinels (watchdogs) take turns staying awake and vigilant. Therefore, the occurrence of nighttime awakenings is the product of survivability. The sentinel hypothesis was first thought of by psychologist Frederick Snyder back in 1966. It had never been confirmed as applicable to humans, until now. </p>\r\n<p>In the current study, researchers examined the sleep patterns of the Hadza people of Tanzania, who still live the hunter-gatherer lifestyle. They found that during a period of over 200 hours, all members of the tribe were only asleep at the same time for a short 18 minutes. They researchers also determined that variation in chronotype -- defined as the individual propensity to sleep at a particular time during a 24-hour period - was driven by age. The younger Hazda people were more likely to be night \"owls\" while the elders were often the \"larks,\" or the early risers.</p>\r\n<p>The sleep patterns that we have today have been inherited by our ancestors. Younger kids stay out late while older people generally go to bed early. “Researchers have theorized that one of the reasons grandparents live so long past their reproductive years is that their function is to take care of grandchildren,” explains co-author <a href=\"https://www.utoronto.ca/news/why-your-teen-stays-late-you-sleep-poorly-new-research-confirms-sentinel-theory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">David Samson</a>. “Our hypothesis is that their lark behavior and shorter sleep times serve a function: the elders serve as sentinels at the times of day when others are sleeping. Therefore, it’s important to have people of all ages in any population.”</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps your grandparents find themselves sleeping less because they're just \"wakeful elders\" carrying out out their evolutionary duty to protect. This is definitely a fascinating theory, and it could potentially explain the poorer sleep patterns of older people. </p>",

But now this new research is indicating that it can also impact our happiness.  </p>\r\n<p>In the study, the team separated 40 healthy adult volunteers into two groups: one that stayed awake for 28 hours and another that slept for a full 8 hours. They were then asked to identify happy, sad or neutral faces. Those who were sleep deprived were far less likely to focus on the smiling faces. </p>\r\n<p>This makes sense because there is a link between insomnia and depression. People who suffer from insomnia are three times more likely to report thoughts of suicide and at least <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181883/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">three-quarters</a> of clinically depressed people struggle with sleep. Furthermore, sleep disturbances increase the likelihood of non-depressed people becoming depressed. </p>\r\n<p>Sleep deprivation is a growing problem in the US. In fact, the CDC recognized insufficient sleep as a \"<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/features/dssleep/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">public health </a><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/features/dssleep/\">epidemic</a>,\" with an estimated 50 to 70 million adults suffering from sleep or wakefulness disorders. </p>\r\n<p>In order to be healthy and happy, you need to get enough sleep.

            "body_html": "<p>Sleeping naked has tons of health benefits, but only 8% of Americans sleep sans clothes. Most people don't know that sleeping naked is good for you. We're here to let you in on a <em>dirty little secret</em>: There are actual scientific reasons why sleeping naked is better for you.</p>\n<p>1. Your sleep will improve</p>\n<p>Your body temperature naturally declines as part of your circadian rhythm, and wearing pajamas could disrupt this natural drop in temperature, which then could disrupt your body's sleep cycle. Being too hot can also lead to restlessness and insomnia.</p>\n<p>2. It's good for your lady parts</p>\n<p>Underwear can be a breeding ground for infection-causing bacteria. Ditching the underwear will allow your vagina to air out and stay clean and healthy. </p>\n<p>3. Your skin and hair will grow</p>\n<p>Being too warm at night disrupts the release of melatonin and growth hormone - the two main anti-aging hormones. Wearing your birthday suit to bed helps you cool down, and as your body temperature drops, growth hormone is released and works it's magic. </p>\n<p>4. You'll eat better</p>\n<p>The stress hormone cortisol decreases while you sleep. However, if your sleep is interrupted from tossing and turning due to uncomfortable pajamas or overheating, your body will produce more cortisol than usual. Excess cortisol is known to intensify your appetite: hello stress eating! </p>\n<p>5. It burns calories</p>\n<p>Sleeping naked may help you lose weight. Apparently keeping yourself cool while you sleep speeds the body's metabolism. Your body also creates more brown fat to keep you warm, and brown fat produces heat by burning calories. Aside from burning calories, sleeping in the buff can make you buff, thanks to the release of the muscle-building human growth hormone. </p>\n<p>6. It builds confidence</p>\n<p>Stripping it down makes you more comfortable in your own skin. As you get more comfortable with your body, your self-esteem and confidence increase. </p>\n<p>7. Two words: More Sex </p>\n<p>Skin to skin contact helps increase the feel-good chemicals in your body, like oxytocin. You'll feel closer to your partner and more often in the mood for sex. Naked spooning encourages sex and leads to happier relationships! </p>\n<p>We realize that sleeping in the nude isn't for everyone so If you are Team PJs, opt for something light and airy to keep you cool. </p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Sleep has a huge impact on learning, and not getting enough can negatively affect memory, cognition, and motivation. While you're sleeping, the brain is hard at work reactivating and reorganizing recently learned material, which helps improve memory and boost performance. This is why you need a good night's sleep before a big test. Unfortunately, most college students do the exact opposite. </p>\n<p>Staying up late to cram for an exam is not doing any good. A <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-03171-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recent study</a>, published in the journal of Scientific Report, says college students who did not go to bed or wake up at consistent times every day were more likely to have lower grades. Irregular sleep and wake patterns are common amongst universities. In fact, most students have the worst sleep schedules. They'll stay up 'til 4 AM on a Wednesday, wake up at noon on Thursday, and then wake up for their 8 AM chem lab on Friday. Going to sleep and waking up at different times everyday messes up your circadian cycle in that it delays the rhythms by almost three hours, on average. This means that if the student has an 8 AM class, it would actually be happening at 5 AM, biological time. The research found that throwing your body off like so was associated with poorer academic performance amongst their participants. Another study by the <a href=\"http://www.aasmnet.org/articles.aspx?id=4780\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">American Academy of Sleep Medicine</a> concluded that poor sleep habits are a strong predictor of academic problems like dropping classes and bad grades. </p>\n<p>Sleep is necessary to thrive both academically and socially. However, <a href=\"http://uanews.ua.edu/2014/08/sleepy-students-emphasize-studies-social-activity-to-detriment-of-health-according-to-ua-study/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">60% of the college population gets insufficient sleep</a>. A nationwide study by <a href=\"https://jawbone.com/blog/university-students-sleep/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jawbone</a> saw that students slept less than 7 hours on 46.2% of the nights. Between studying and partying and other extracurriculars, there is a lot to do on campus. Sleep and rest are often low on most students' lists of priorities. This needs to change. There needs to be more awareness about sleep and the implications of sleep deprivation. A healthy, happy, and high-achieving person is a well-rested person. </p>\n<p>The easiest way to improve your sleep is to optimize your zzz's. At Eight, we make smart products designed to help you sleep. Our mattress was built for universal comfort and support. Way better than that bed your fraternity brother passed down to you!

            "body_html": "<p>Have you ever wished for more hours in the day? Probably! </p>\r\n<p>Sometimes we have so much to do that sleep feels like it's getting in the way. However, we all know how important sleep is, which is why we can't skip it all together. But, there are ways to make your sleep more efficient. In fact, research shows it's not the number of hours you get that matters the most -- it's the quality of the hours you're getting. This means that you don't need to be confined to those 8 hours. You just need enough sleep to give your body a chance to recover, recharge, and refresh. </p>\r\n<p>There is a simple method you can follow to \"hack\" your sleep. Just like you can train your way to a better body, you can train your way to better sleep. According to <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/healthy/more-energy/can-i-train-my-body-to-need-less-sleep\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jim Horne</a>, sleep neurologist at Loughborough University, almost everyone can cut the amount of sleep they need down to six hours a night by following a few easy steps. </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Step 1: Set your alarm for the same time every morning, no matter what day it is</strong></p>\r\n<p>This means you should be waking up at 7 AM on a Saturday morning. We know it sounds horrible, but waking up at the same time every day will train your circadian rhythm and help you get used to the mornings. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Step 2: For the first week, delay the time you go to bed by 20 minutes.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Step 3: For the second week, delay it by 40 minutes. </strong></p>\r\n<p>Remember, even though you are going to sleep later, you're still waking up at the same time.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step 4: For the third week, delay it by an hour.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Step 5: Continue cutting down in 20 minute increments until you are sleeping 6 hours a night.</strong></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>There are plenty of other ways to optimize your sleep that don't involve such strict rules. The first step in understanding what your body needs is tracking your sleep. The Eight Smart Mattress measures all of the important factors regarding sleep, such as hours slept, amount of deep and light sleep, number of toss and turns, etc. There is even a sleep experiment you can do for 7 consecutive days to learn your exact sleep goal. Once the tracker understands your nighttime behavior, it can set a baseline sleep quality. You may find out that you don't need as much sleep as you thought to feel your best. </p>\r\n<p>You should also treat your bed like a recharging station. The reason you need to sleep is because your body needs the downtime to recharge. After being worked so hard during the day, it needs to rest. If you're trying to be more productive during the day, you must get rid of the temptation to treat your bed like anything other than a resting surface. Spend your waking hours out of bed. Staying in bed all weekend watching movies is going to make it much harder to leave your comfy covers come Monday. As long as you only use your bed for sleep, you'll have an easier time getting out of it in the morning. </p>\r\n<p>Another way to thrive on less sleep is exercising early in the day. For one, it helps you stay consistent and gives you a routine. Working out in the morning also yields deeper sleep at night. People who work out on a treadmill at 7 AM experience deeper sleep cycles and spend 75% more time in the most reparative stages of slumber than those who exercise at later times that day. Getting more deep sleep is what ensures your body gets the chance to rejuvenate. </p>\r\n<p>If you want to make the most out of the sleep you get, the above tips are good places to start. It is a process, but it is possible to maximize your zzz's in a shorter time. </p>",

Think about it. . . you seem to wake up so effortlessly before a trip to Italy, even if you have to be at the airport at 6 AM on a Monday. According to a <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-07/nu-pil070617.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new study</a>, there is a reason for this. </p>\r\n<p>Scientists from Northwestern Medicine and Rush University Medical Center concluded that one way to guarantee yourself a good night's sleep is to have a purpose in life. In short, have something worth getting out of bed for. </p>\r\n<p>In the first research of its kind, the scientists found that having a purpose in life results in fewer nighttime disturbances and improved sleep quality. They asked participants to rate their life purpose in addition to answering questions about their sleep. Although the participants in the study were elderly, researchers said the findings are likely to apply to the broader public. </p>\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n<p><span>\"Helping people cultivate a purpose in life could be an effective drug-free strategy to improve sleep quality, particularly for a population that is facing more insomnia,\" said senior author Jason Ong, an associate professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \"Purpose in life is something that can be cultivated and enhanced through mindfulness therapies.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The next step in this research would be to find a connection between mindfulness therapies and improved sleep quality. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>What exactly is mindfulness? Well, it is the ability to be fully present, aware of where we are what we're doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what's going on around us. Practicing mindfulness helps reduce stress and cultivates a calmer persona. </span>Being mindful cognitively changes our ability to see ourselves in the world and find a meaningful purpose. </p>\r\n<p>When you practice mindfulness, you will probably get a better night's sleep because it helps clear your head and calm you down. If you aren't aware of the present moment, your mind will get stuck in maladaptive ways of thinking. For example, obsessing over tomorrow's meeting is not conducive for drifting off to sleep. Deep breaths and simple relaxation techniques will help wind you down before bed. You can check out some simple meditation guides <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/mindfulmagazine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. </p>\r\n<p>Another way to achieve your life's purpose is to do something you love everyday. Enjoying the little things in life is the first step in finding a happy, meaningful existence. Try dedicating 5 minutes every morning to listening to your favorite song. Or you can do a fun workout. Or you can eat your favorite breakfast.</p>\r\n<p>Being in the proper mindset is imperative to getting a good night's sleep. Once you've found your headspace, you should rest your head on something comfortable, too.

            "created_at": "2017-07-06T14:30:28-04:00",
            "body_html": "<p>Ugh, is it morning already??? </p>\n<p>If you're the type of person who wakes up feeling groggy and exhausted, there is an explanation. Actually, there are several reasons why you might feel so tired, even after getting a solid amount of sleep. </p>\n<p><strong>1. Your bedroom is too dark </strong></p>\n<p>You may love sleeping in utter darkness, but your beloved blackout curtains could be the culprit of your tiredness. If no daylight can seep through your windows, your internal clock won't know day from night. Exposure to sunshine in the morning will signal your brain that it's time to wake up and help you feel more refreshed. </p>\n<p><strong>2. Late-night technology </strong></p>\n<p>We know it's hard to disconnect from the world, but all that harsh blue light from your TV, laptop, and phone stimulates the brain and makes it difficult to settle down before bed. Try to shut off your technology about an hour before going to sleep. If you really can't do that, at least power down your phone. You can save your Instagram scrolling for the next day. </p>\n<p><strong>3. Too many distractions</strong></p>\n<p>If you live in a busy city, it may be difficult to tune out the honking cars and barking dogs at night. Being woken up in the middle of the night will cause you to feel extra tired the next day. In order to eliminate some of those distractions, invest in a white noise machine or keep a fan on low to down out any of the sounds that may wake you. Outdoor noises can only be silenced so much, but you do have total control over what's inside your house. Make sure to fix that running toilet of yours and put your phone on silent, as a 2 AM text notification could definitely interrupt your slumber. </p>\n<p><strong>4. All that coffee </strong></p>\n<p>It is recommended to stop drinking caffeinated beverages by mid-afternoon or earlier. Caffeine interrupts the flow of melatonin - the chemical that sends us to sleep, and drinking a bunch of coffee during the day will negatively effect your sleep patterns. Besides keeping you awake, caffeine can also cause heartburn, which can make sleep awfully uncomfortable. </p>\n<p><strong>5. The food you ate </strong></p>\n<p>A healthy lifestyle leads to healthier sleep, specifically your diet. Foods high in sugar, fat, and processed carbs have been associated with daytime sleepiness. You should also avoid foods that cause indigestion, acid reflux, or heartburn such as spicy foods, tomato sauce, or citrus fruits. Heartburn is exacerbated when you lie down as it allows the acid to creep up into the esophagus and burn the sensitive lining. </p>\n<p><strong>6. You are actually not a morning person </strong></p>\n<p>According to science, there are morning people and night people, and it has to do with your circadian system. The circadian system is a region of 20,000 nerve cells that keeps your body on schedule throughout the day, regulating everything from hormone levels to when you feel tired. Some people are \"phase advanced,\" meaning they feel tired early in the evening. Others are \"phase delayed,\" meaning you don't feel tired until late at night. Even though not being a morning person is your biology, you can hack the system. Sticking to a regimented sleep schedule and avoiding light before bed will help you feel tired earlier and make mornings easier. </p>\n<p>To sum it all up, a good night's sleep isn't just about the amount of shuteye you get. You need to sleep in a quality environment conducive for sleep. This means parting the blinds up for some sunlight, turning off your devices, limiting your caffeine intake, and eating well.

            "body_html": "<p>For the longest time, we have accepted the Freudian perspective on dreams - that dreams are highly symbolic representations of unconscious desire. Today, however, most brain scientists are rejecting that idea. </p>\r\n<p>There are many theories as to why people dream, and despite the scientific progress in recent years, it still remains a big mystery. What we do know is that dreams seem to replay everyday life. Many researchers believe dreams have a close relationship to the way our brains process memories. Dreaming may be a way for the brain to \"take new information, combine it with old information in these totally strange ways, and see if it can get any insights in the usefulness of that information, says <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/06/22/533834764/forget-freud-dreams-replay-everyday-life\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Robert Stickgold</a>, a sleep researcher at Harvard Medical School. </p>\r\n<p>Dreams occur during REM sleep, and so does a process called memory consolidation. During REM sleep, the brain relives recent experiences and stores them into long-term memory. Some scientists believe dreaming is an essential part of this memory processing while others think it's just a byproduct of the brain's nighttime activity. </p>\r\n<p>Another theory calls dreams an extension of waking consciousness, meaning dreams reflect the experience of real life. At sleep onset, students preparing for exams commonly re-experience the material they were studying during the day, lovers have fantasies about their romantic partner, and software developers often see bits of code unfolding in their mind's eye. </p>\r\n<p>Although Freud's theory has little scientific proof, some of his observations are still relevant. For instance, he talked about common dream symbols - such as having one's teeth fall out. He went on to explain this as a symbol for castration. Maybe that's true, maybe it's not. But it is interesting that tons of people have this type of dream. Perhaps we share many dreams because we share the same nervous system design, and many of the same anxieties. </p>\r\n<p>Dreams are such an enigma because they deal with consciousness, a concept that has baffled scientists and philosophers for centuries. When you dream, you are in an altered state of consciousness. It's not the same as wakeful consciousness, but you are experiencing something that appears completely real. Lucid dreaming - when the dreamer is aware of dreaming - opens intriguing possibilities for the study of consciousness. Some researchers say lucid dreaming is a state in which the brain is simultaneously awake and dreaming. Therefore, it may be possible to have dreamers ask themselves in the moment what their dreams mean. WHOA. </p>\r\n<p>Clearly, there is still a lot of research needed to understand dreams. But for now, we're just going to take a night to sleep on all this information...</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/l0MYEqEzwMWFCg8rm/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p>\r\n<p> </p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Vacations are meant for rest and relaxation, so why is that we often struggle to sleep on our hotel's heavenly bed? </p>\r\n<p>Well, it turns out that your brain is the blame. It appears that half of your brain may remain alert when you sleep in a new location, especially on the first night away from home. Scientists call this phenomenon the \"First Night Effect,\" and they've known about it for <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1966.tb02650.x/abstract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">over 50 years</a>. </p>\r\n<p>In order to better understand this effect, scientists from <a href=\"https://news.brown.edu/articles/2016/04/sleep\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brown University</a> devised an interesting experiment. They hooked people up to brain-monitoring equipment and played quiet beeping noises by each ear of the sleeper. Researchers found that on the first night of the experiment, the left side of the brain reacted strongly to the sound, compared with the right side. It wasn't the entire left hemisphere affected, but only the default mode network - a group of brain regions associated with spontaneous unfocused mental activity, like daydreaming. Noises played on the left side more frequently woke people up, as well. However, on the second night of the experiment, both brain hemispheres responded at the same level, and the beeps woke fewer people up. </p>\r\n<p>This suggests that humans may be a bit like birds when they sleep. Birds sleep with one eye open and half of their brain awake so that they can stay alert and make important fight or flight decisions. Although we don't sleep with one eye open, something about an unfamiliar environment is keeping our left side of the brain awake. We subconsciously want to stay awake due to the increased anxiety we have around sleeping away from home. It is an adaptive and animalistic response that provides us with protection when sleeping in novel environments. </p>\r\n<p>In order to reduce the first night effect, make your hotel room feel more like your bedroom. Bringing your own pillow and doing the same nighttime routine may trick your brain into thinking you are at home. Staying in a familiar hotel brand will also help ease your mind and make you sleep more comfortable. </p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Whether it's pickle juice, bananas, Pedialyte, or a greasy burger, we all have our preferred hangover remedies. While there's no sure-fire \"cure\" for a hangover, there are methods that work better than others in alleviating that brutal headache. </p>\r\n<p>Hangovers usually involve a gnarly headache, nausea, irritability, and tiredness. The main cause of your hangover symptoms is dehydration, which is why it is important to drink plenty of water - before, during, and after a night of drinking. However, many of us forget to drink water when we go out. With a boozy drink already in hand, it's hard to think of hydrating with something other than a gin and tonic. </p>\r\n<p>With water out of the question, the next best cure - and the one that works every time, is sleep. Alcohol significantly disrupts sleep. It reduces REM sleep, wakes you up before you're truly rested, and aggravates breathing problems. This is why you often feel tired after a night of heavy drinking. The only way to get rid of that feeling is to catch up on the sleep you missed the night before. If you can manage to nod off for an hour or two, you might just feel better. </p>\r\n<p>Sleeping can also help prevent a hangover. Getting enough sleep will improve your immunity and get your body ready to handle a night of drinking. When the body is well-equipped, it can better process alcohol. </p>\r\n<p>When it comes to hangovers, the phrase \"sleeping it off,\" has never been truer. Get a good night's sleep, and you'll feel good in the morning! </p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://media4.giphy.com/media/CfJwEbFfJ8ehW/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Laughter truly is the best medicine. It releases all the feel-good chemicals, relieves stress, and stimulates the organs.</p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p>A simple burst of laughter can decrease depression and anxiety, lower blood pressure, manage pain, enhance creativity and productivity, burn calories, and more. Unfortunately, most adults have little laughter in their lives. Children laugh about 150 times a day while adults only laugh about 12 times per day. If we just laughed a little more, we could be so much happier. And lifelong happiness begins in the morning. Waking up on the right side of the bed can do wonders for your mood. </p>\n<p>In an interview with <a href=\"http://www.byrdie.com/how-to-become-happy/slide9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BYRDIE</a>, laughter coach Francine Shore shared nine tips for waking up and feeling great. </p>\n<p><strong>1. Start your morning with gratitude </strong></p>\n<p>The first thing you should do every morning is write down three things you're grateful for. Even if yesterday was horrible, there are always positive things to be grateful for. The practice of physically writing down these positives is restorative. It allows you to approach the day from a place of contentment, not bitterness. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/CbH03dCwjTUzK/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"277\" height=\"136\"></p>\n<p><strong>2. Smile</strong></p>\n<p>This is the simplest thing to do. One smile can trick your mind into feeling happier. When you smile, your body releases endorphins and serotonin, which make you feel good. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/B0vFTrb0ZGDf2/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"279\" height=\"147\"></p>\n<p><strong>3. Take a deep breath</strong></p>\n<p>Another easy thing to do. Taking a few minutes to breath deeply each morning have significant mood-boosting effects. Deep breathing promotes feelings of calm and relieves stress. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/GJycRLp6zYGFq/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\" height=\"137\"></p>\n<p><strong>4. Go outside</strong></p>\n<p>The happiest people are those who spend time in sunshine and nature. Nature has the ability to heal and awaken the senses. According to Shore, nature reminds us that there is \"something larger out there in the universe,\" and this helps us reign in our egos. She also notes that taking a moment to notice the beauty that surrounds us helps us remember that \"there truly is good in the world.\" Even if you don't live near a beach or mountains, you can still benefit by taking a stroll through the park or walking to work instead of riding the subway. </p>\n<p> <img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/TnDoEoXfT7YoE/giphy-downsized-large.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"272\" height=\"153\"></p>\n<p><strong>5. Just dance</strong></p>\n<p>Music and dance actually make you happier. Dancing to good music connects with the emotional centers in the brain. It releases endorphins and reduces levels of cortisol - the stress hormone. Because we spend so much time cooped up in an office in front of a screen, we don't get much time to run around and be free. Dancing and singing makes you feel good because it makes you feel alive. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media4.giphy.com/media/iPTTjEt19igne/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"286\" height=\"161\"></p>\n<p><strong>6. Wear bright colors</strong></p>\n<p>Wearing a pop of color will immediately brighten your mood and it has the ability to enhance someone else's mood when they're with you. If you're feeling sad, wear yellow. Yellow is considered the brightest and most cheerful of all the colors. If you're feeling anxious, choose something more soothing like lavender or light blue. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media1.giphy.com/media/10NU78sKOSQXcI/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"287\" height=\"157\"></p>\n<p><strong>7. Volunteer</strong></p>\n<p>\"Volunteering helps us develop a deeper sense of compassion and creates a sense of joy and community, Shore says. It helps you get out of your own head and do something for the greater good. You don't have to be a full blown activist for this to work. Spend a morning walking dogs at a local animal shelter. That'll cheer you right up! </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media0.giphy.com/media/l4hLQsWNKcQmFCWmA/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"289\" height=\"163\"></p>\n<p><strong>8. Play with a puppy </strong></p>\n<p>Speaking of dogs, our blood pressure physically lowers when we pet and play with animals. Cats and dogs give unconditional love, which makes us feel more connected and secure. This then promotes feelings of calmness and happiness. If you aren't lucky enough to have a furry pet of your own, ask someone to pet their dog in the morning. We're sure they won't mind! </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media4.giphy.com/media/l0ExvA6hnrdzQ5zoI/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"290\" height=\"163\"></p>\n<p><strong>9. Watch something funny</strong></p>\n<p>At the end of the day, it's important to do anything that'll keep you laughing. Put on an episode of <em>Parks and Recreation</em> before bed or watch a funny movie on Netflix. \"Find the funny in the most ordinary of places,\" says Shore. \"Choose levity in your life. It's a positive coping mechanism.\"</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/xUPGclJ5wKOJmENxcs/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"173\"></p>\n<p><strong>BONUS: Sleep on Eight, and wake up happier! </strong></p>\n<p>With the Eight Smart Mattress, you'll feel like you're sleeping on a cloud and you'll wake feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day! </p>",

The researchers surveyed over 2,000 participants to find the exact time - down to the very minute - it takes for sleep to most effectively boost your happiness. </p>\n<p>Participants who slept <strong>seven hours and six minutes</strong> rated themselves as \"perfectly happy.\" People who slept seven hours rated themselves as \"mostly happy,\" and those who slept for six hours and 54 minutes reported themselves as \"somewhat happy.\" Apparently those who got less than six hours 48 minutes of sleep marked themselves as having unhappiness within their relationships as well as anxiety. </p>\n<p>It seems as though the mood benefits of sleep boils down to a number game. Sleeping just a couple minutes less can make a notable difference in emotional well-being. </p>\n<p>Sleep experts recommend a minimum of seven hours of sleep, but maybe now it's okay to hit the snooze button a few times in order to get those extra six minutes. </p>\n<p>It's important to note that quality of sleep is equally as important as the quantity of sleep. The same survey showed that \"participants who meditate or take a shower before getting into bed got the best sleep.\" On the other hand, those who did work or played video games before bed got worse sleep. Relaxing before bed helps you achieve a restful sleep. The Eight Sleep Tracker measures whether you've had a restful sleep or not by telling you how many times you tossed and turned and how many times you woke up in the night. The less your sleep is disturbed, the higher the quality. </p>\n<p>Getting sufficient sleep is vital for your health and happiness. It repairs your body, organizes your mind, boosts your energy levels, and regulates your mood. So let's start prioritizing good sleep, you'll thank us later. 😊</p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Tired of waking up with a sore neck or back pain? Well, your pillow could be the underlying problem. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillows impact the quality of our sleep, and the wrong pillow can keep us from getting a good night’s rest. You need a pillow that will keep your neck and spine aligned in a neutral position while sleeping. Because everyone is different, not every pillow is perfect for everyone. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The key is to find a pillow that is the right height and firmness for the person's size, sleeping position, and personal preferences, which is why we developed the <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/pages/ultimatepillow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ultimate Pillow</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/Screen_Shot_2017-07-11_at_10.03.37_AM_grande.png?v=1499793048\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ultimate Pillow is an adjustable pillow that fits to your individual needs. It </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is stuffed with three individual layers so you can customize the height and firmness of your pillow for ultimate comfort depending on how you sleep</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read below for tips on finding the proper alignment and how you can adjust your Eight Ultimate Pillow to achieve it.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Back Sleepers</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When lying on your back, a pillow should support the natural curvature of your neck. You want a pillow that’s a little firmer so the head doesn’t go back too far. The pillow should also have contouring properties so it can take on the shape of your head. A medium-firm memory foam pillow offers the best support for back sleepers because it contours to the head while also providing structure and stability between the neck and spine. You can use the insertable cushions to add extra loft in the bottom third of the pillow to cradle your neck. The height of the pillow should be neither too high so that it tilts the head too far forward, nor too low that it extends the neck and tilts the head upwards. Generally, the pillow should be around 3 to 6 inches thick to provide adequate support.  </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/1pillow_illustrations_back_grande.jpg?v=1498848458\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p><b>Side Sleepers</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike back and stomach sleepers, side sleepers require extra support. Because of the greater distance between their heads and the mattress, side sleepers typically need thicker and firmer pillows to keep their head and neck in a neutral position. Make sure your pillow is the right thickness between your ear and your mattress so that the neck is evenly aligned with the spine. The best pillow for side sleepers is one that will stay firm all through the night. The memory foam layer in the Ultimate Pillow will do just that, while maintaining the pillow’s shape and stabilizing the neck, as well.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/1pillow_illustrations_side_grande.jpg?v=1498848472\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p><b>Stomach Sleepers</b></p>\n<p>If possible, avoid sleeping on your stomach as it’s difficult to maintain the proper spinal position. When lying on your belly, your back is compressed and your neck is usually twisted, which causes discomfort. However, if you are absolutely adamant about sleeping on your stomach, opt for a softer and lower pillow that will cradle the head. You want to have less fill in your pillow than those who sleep on their side or back. If you sleep on your stomach with a pillow that’s too thick, your spine will bend at an angle which is more likely to cause aches and pains.</p>\n<p><b>Firmness</b></p>\n<p><b><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/4_grande.jpg?v=1499351897\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A pillow that is too firm will not allow your neck to fully relax while asleep. However, a pillow that is too soft may not offer enough support. This is where our Ultimate Pillow comes in handy. You can adjust the firmness by rearranging the layers and adding or removing the cushions until your neck feels properly supported. For a firmer pillow, sleep with the memory foam piece on top. For the softest, remove the  memory foam and just sleep on the cushions.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<p><b>How To Test Your Pillow</b></p>\n<p>Wondering how to find if your pillow is right for you? Here’s a quick test you can do.</p>\n<p>1. Stand next to a wall as if you were lying down on your mattress. For example, a back sleeper should stand with their back against the wall and side sleeper should stand with their side against the wall.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/1_grande.jpg?v=1499710828\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p>\n<p>2. Rest your head against the wall. Notice how your neck and head probably isn’t straight with your spine. It’s the job of your pillow to fill this gap.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/2_1_grande.jpg?v=1499710961\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>3. Put the pillow in between your head and the wall. If your spine is straight from your neck to back, you’ve found the right pillow for your body.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/3_grande.jpg?v=1499711083\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>4.Adjust the layers of the pillow accordingly until you body is perfectly aligned.</p>\n<ol></ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>At Eight, we're dedicated to helping you sleep better, and better sleep requires a good mattress and a proper pillow.

            "created_at": "2017-06-27T17:40:20-04:00",
            "body_html": "<p>In the beginning of June, thousands of researchers gathered in Boston to present new research and discuss the latest developments in clinical sleep medicine and sleep science. Here are some highlights from the <a href=\"http://www.sleepmeeting.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SLEEP 2017 CONFERENCE</a>. </p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Regular sleep is linked to happiness</strong></p>\r\n<p>Researchers from MIT measured the sleep habits of college students for one month. They calculated something called a sleep regularity index, which was the likelihood of being awake or asleep across all time-points during the day. Results showed that higher regular sleep schedules are significantly associated with higher morning and evening happiness, healthiness, and calmness. </p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Sleep loss makes us prone to risky behavior</strong></p>\r\n<p>According to psychologists from Iowa State University, we're most prone to taking risks when we're moderately tired rather than full-on sleep-deprived. Why? Sleep loss makes us prone to risky behavior because it impairs mental processes involved in self-control. However, when we're super exhausted, we lack the ability and energy to follow through on impulses. A slightly tired person, on the other hand, has less self-control and enough energy to take risks.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Positive thinking helps you sleep </strong></p>\r\n<p>Rumination, the act of repeatedly obsessing over negative thoughts, can get in the way of sleep. On the contrary, positive types of repetitive thought - called savoring - can actually promote sleep. Researchers at the University of Alabama, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Virginia Commonwealth, and South Texas Veterans Health Care System studied the relationship between sleep, rumination, and savoring. Rumination was associated with poor health and disturbed sleep while savoring predicted lower levels of disturbed sleep.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Successful people aren't sending late-night tweets</strong></p>\r\n<p>Sorry Donald Trump, but successful people aren't spending the wee hours of the night tweeting. According to preliminary data from sociologists at Stony Brook University, late night behavior on Twitter can be used as a proxy for not sleeping. The researchers studied game stats and twitter account activity for 112 NBA players. They found that NBA players scored fewer points and took fewer shots when they'd send tweets the night before a game. </p>\r\n<p><strong>5. To remember more, run around <em>and</em> rest up</strong></p>\r\n<p>Researchers from the University of Montreal and the University of Glasgow sought to see if exercise and sleep, combined, affect memory more than either of them do alone. For the study, young adults completed a memory task after doing one of three activities: moderate exercise, hour-long naps, or both. They found that the group who did the exercise-nap combo scored the highest on the memory task. </p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Quality over quantity for better sleep</strong></p>\r\n<p>Derk Dijk, a researcher of sleep and circadian rhythms, studied what makes a person more likely to report better sleep. He found that low number of awakenings and high amount of REM both predicted a subjective report of feeling refreshed. Total sleep time was not a significant factor. </p>\r\n<p><strong>7. Insomniacs have the realest dreams</strong></p>\r\n<p>Psychologists at Laval University in Quebec tested their hypothesis that insomniacs continue to process information even after they hit the sack. They talked about something called dream incorporation, which refers to the act of incorporating aspects of your external environment into your dreams. Because insomniacs fall asleep in a hyper-aroused state, they incorporate more elements from their environments into their dreams than normal sleepers. </p>\r\n<p><strong>8. Sleep can help you recover from depression</strong></p>\r\n<p>Patients with comorbid depression and insomnia who sleep at least 7 hours nightly are more likely to benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy than those who sleep less. The research shows that sleeping more before starting treatment can increase your chances of recovering from depression and insomnia. </p>",

New research from The Ohio State University Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research suggests that sleeping less causes you to behave more negatively during a conflict. It also puts you at risk for stress-related inflammation. Specifically, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170626105142.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the study</a> focused on couples. The research team recruited 43 couples who would provide blood samples, answer questions about their sleep habits, and then try to resolve a topic that sparks conflict in their relationship. </p>\r\n<p>When both partners slept less than seven hours the night before, they were much more reactive during the conflict, and responded to each other with increased hostility, criticism, and contempt. For every hour of sleep lost, the researchers found that levels of two known inflammatory markers rose 6 percent. Higher levels of these inflammatory factors have been linked to a higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis. </p>\r\n<p>The study reported that half of the couples had slept less than the recommended seven hours, which is higher than the current national average. The CDC reports 35% of Americans get less than seven hours of sleep. </p>\r\n<p>The good news is that if one partner was well-rested, the disagreements tended to be neutralized. This just one more reason why getting enough sleep should be prioritized. Better sleep brings happier marriages! </p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Can't sleep? We might finally have a solution for you. Luc Beaudoin, a cognitive scientist from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, invented a method to help people fall asleep.</p>\n<p>When people struggle to fall asleep, they usually think about not being able to sleep, which then makes it even harder to fall asleep. He came up with a technique called \"<a href=\"https://mysleepbutton.com/support/do-it-yourself-cognitive-shuffle-sdi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cognitive shuffling</a>,\" which is meant to distract the brain and lull it into that groggy state that proceeds a sleep cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you do the cognitive shuffle?</strong> </p>\n<p>It's a simple word game that you play in your head. Pick a word that contains at least five letters. Take the first letter, and create a new list of words that begin with it, then vividly picture each in your mind. When you run out of ideas, move on to the next letter. When you finish all of those letters, think of a new word. </p>\n<p>Let's try it out: </p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">CARING</strong></p>\n<p>Which starts with the letter \"C\" so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Cat, camp, candy, Christmas, cow. . .</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The next letter in CARING is \"A\" so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Apple, avenue, angel, athlete. . .</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you don't feel like doing all that thinking, you can download his app  <a href=\"https://mysleepbutton.com/home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mySleepButton</a>. Turn it on, close your eyes, and listen to a voice read out a list of random things. Imagine them in your mind as you fall asleep. For example, you might hear \"a girl adjusting her ponytail\" followed by \"a child talking to Superman.\" Seems odd, but the mix of these mental images distracts the conscious brain while your body gets on with the natural process of drifting off to sleep. </p>",

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be challenging enough deciding between an innerspring or a foam mattress. But when you throw gel in the mix, the decision can become even more confusing. Eight is here to help. Here are the differences to consider between a foam and a gel mattress:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Materials</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both foam and gel mattresses are made from viscoelastic, a material that reacts to weight and body temperature. Gel foam mattresses, however, are infused with, what else, gel. This gel is often throughout the entire mattress but sometimes is only found in one layer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight is unique in that it has four high density foam layers that make up the mattress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–2” of latex-like foam (responds like latex but provides better support and breathability)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–2” of memory foam (provides the right comfort and support)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–2” of transition foam (equally distributes weight and lets the mattress adapt better to your sleep position)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–4” of support foam (guarantees the right support and durability of the mattress)</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Foam</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foam mattresses like Eight’s mattress provide support to your entire body so you never wake up feeling sore. Foam does not transfer movement easily, so you won’t be disturbed by a partner’s tossing and turning. Memory foam is the perfect balance between firm and soft. Memory foam mattresses not made with the right type of foam can cause people to sleep warm.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Gel</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main difference from foam mattresses is the inclusion of gel. Gel added to foam allows heat to escape that in poorly made memory foam mattresses could cause you to become too hot during the night, making it hard to sleep.  Gel mattresses feel cool when you first lay down on them, but that feeling may only last a  few minutes since the gel takes on the temperature of the environment it is in.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>The Verdict</b></p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main difference between the two types of mattresses is in heat retention. Gel infused foam mattresses aim to make you sleep cooler, but they do not necessarily stay cool.  Our mattress is designed to stay cool overnight thanks to its premium materials and composition.  If you purchase a top quality foam mattress like the Eight mattress, there is no need for gel in the mattress. Still can’t decide which type of mattress is right for you? Sleep on it. Eight offers a 100 night trial for you to try our unique foam mattress for yourself. </span>",

Men with younger children had an average sleep score of 69 while men with older children had a sleep score of 74. That is a 5 point difference! When self-reporting their sleep quality, men with younger children were less likely to rate their sleep as restful, with 44% saying their sleep quality was \"good\" compared to 65% of fathers with older children. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other factors were considered, such as occupation and marital status, but those did not have a notable impact on a father’s sleep. Being married or in a domestic partnership had a slight significance that deserves to be mentioned. On average, 47% of married fathers rated their sleep as “good” compared to 39% of divorced fathers. Married fathers also slept the longest with 7 hours 23 minutes while divorced fathers only slept an average of 6 hours 24 minutes. Moreover, divorced fathers had the lowest sleep score -  61.5. Despite this stark contrast, further analysis is required due to a skewed number of married participants. </span></p>\n<p>The conclusions from this report confirm previous studies about fatherhood and sleep.

Of 21 mother-father pairs enjoying their first infant experience, fathers actually got less sleep than the mothers and experienced more confirmed sleepiness. The good news is that sleep gets better with age. As the children grow up, fathers reported higher sleep quality and saw higher sleep scores; whereas, mothers did not follow that pattern.</p>\n<p>To read the full report, <a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/Fatherhood_Sleep_Report.pdf?14890403397921161625\">click here</a>. </p>\n<p> </p>",

The summer solstice marks the onset of summer, and will occur in the northern hemisphere at 12:24am (EST). While that extra daylight is nice for backyard picnics and working outdoors, what does it do to our sleep? </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All that sun exposure can make it hard to sleep. Think about it: your body has become accustomed  to the sun setting around the same time every day and then you going to bed a few hours after that. When the sun sets later, your body’s internal clock will be thrown off. You may find it harder to fall asleep since the light doesn’t align with your natural body clock.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The summer solstice can make sleep even more difficult for those already suffer from sleep issues. The increased daylight does not allow enough melatonin, a key ingredient for sleep, to be produced.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2014/06/20/health-doctors-warn-summer-solstice-could-cause-issues-for-those-who-suffer-with-sleep-problems/\"> Melatonin is produced at night, so more daylight means less time for it to be produced.</a></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news? The summer solstice can be an opportune time to reset your body clock if you want to get more sleep and start waking up or going to sleep at different times. The earlier sunrise can cause you to wake up earlier, so if you’ve been meaning to catch that 6 AM workout class, the summer solstice may help! However, the later sunset can make you want to stay up longer. Avoid the extra daylight getting in the way of your 8 hours by using blackout shades.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safely soak up the sun while you can, and use this summer solstice as an opportunity for sunset Instagrams and getting back on track for great sleep.</span></p>",

But can it cause issues with our sleep too?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It turns out that the rising temperatures and increasing levels of carbon dioxide associated with global warming harm both the environment and our sleep.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who live in areas with high levels of carbon dioxide in the air, often caused by cars in traffic, tend to experience sleep disruption over time. A study from the University of Washington found that people who lived in areas with the most air pollution are likely to have more trouble sleeping.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Air pollution has also been linked with </span><a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sleepapnea\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sleep apnea</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a breathing condition that disrupts sleep. According to author Martha E.

As anyone with allergies knows, difficulty breathing negatively affects sleep.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if the air pollution weren’t bad enough, the rise in temperature has been shown to impact sleep as well according to a new article in </span><a href=\"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/5/e1601555\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Science Advances</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Room and body temperature play a key role in falling asleep. If the sleeping environment is too cold or hot, there will be difficulty falling and staying asleep.  Those who do not have air conditioning systems will be affected by sleeplessness caused by global warming.</span></p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to sleep smart, we have to live smart.

Consistently not getting enough sleep significantly harms the brain. The recent study, published in the <a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/21/5263\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Journal of Neuroscience</a>, suggests that losing sleep causes the brain to \"eat itself.\" </div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div><br>\n<div>Researchers led by Michele Bellesi of the Marche Polytechnic University in Italy studied the brains of mice who were well-rested and who were sleep-deprived.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div><br>\n<div>They analyzed the brains of mice that had regular sleep, spontaneous wake, sleep deprivation, and chronic sleep restriction (no sleep for over 5 days). Specifically, they looked at the mice's glial cells, which help clean up the brain and support the neurons. </div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div><br>\n<div>One type of glial cell - an astrocyte - rids the brain of extraneous synapses in an effort to rewire and rejuvenate it. Another, called a microglial cell, is meant to destroy old cells via a process called phagocytosis. </div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div><br>\n<div>Sleep-deprived mice had more active astrocytes than well-rested mice (13.5% synapse activity compared to 5.7%). To put it simply, portions of synapses, or connections, were being eaten by astrocytes due to sleep-deprivation. However, breaking down brain debris may not necessarily be a bad thing. This finding requires a lot more research to fully understand the phenomenon. </div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div><br>\n<div>The experiment also looked at the effect of sleep deprivation the microglial cells, which account for around 15% of cells in the brain.

But just because you aren’t naturally a morning person doesn’t mean you can’t become one.</span></p>\n<iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/FGgf0htHFKTM4\" width=\"480\" height=\"329\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/subway-FGgf0htHFKTM4\">via GIPHY</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waking up early in the morning gives you more time to accomplish tasks. So if you’re feeling overwhelmed with a busy schedule, you have all the more reason to follow these tips to become a morning person.</span></p>\n<p><b>Positivity is everything</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tell yourself you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">do this; you will become a morning person! Do something in the morning that makes you actually want to get out of bed. Dedicate 10 minutes or so every morning to watching your favorite show or listening to your favorite album. Listening to uplifting tunes can also help awaken your senses and set a positive tone for the day. But...</span></p>\n<p><b>Don’t overwhelm the senses immediately</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start the day by doing one small activity at a time.  Don’t immediately start multitasking, but rather ease your brain into daytime activities. If you do listen to music in the morning, start out with some calm coffee shop acoustic before listening to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crazy Train.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Go to bed early</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This sounds like a no-brainer, but it can be trickier than you think. You may feel you have a lot of work left to do before bed, but know that the extra few hours you’ll gain by waking up early the next morning will give you plenty of time to finish. Set an alarm reminding yourself when it’s time to get ready for bed. Eventually, it will become second nature, and you will no longer need the reminder.</span></p>\n<p><b>Ease into it and stick to a schedule </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t try to go from waking up at 8am to 6am in one day. Wake up a half hour earlier each day until you reach your desired wake up time. Once you’re there, stick to it! Also, try not to sleep in too late on the weekends. Eight’s app and sleeptracker lets you track your sleep so you know what time you’re actually waking up each morning.</span></p>\n<p><b>Let it shine</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep the shades in your bedroom half open. It is much easier to wake up to some natural light, and this way you won’t go blind when you open the shades and all the light enters at once.</span></p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow these simple tips, and you’ll be an early riser before you know it!</span>",

Most adults only need 8 hours of sleep a night. Trying to force your body to sleep in past those 8 hours doesn’t usually work too well.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s more, even if you don’t set an alarm, your body acts as a natural alarm clock. Our bodies get accustomed to waking up at the same time during the week for those of us who have 9-5 jobs, and our body’s internal clock does not differentiate between weekends and weekdays.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be frustrating to naturally wake up early on weekends and holidays, but it’s actually a good thing.You may not be able to clock extra hours of weekend sleep, but the bright side is once your body gets used to a routine, it makes it easier to wake up early in the mornings. Your body is no longer fighting with you to make that 9am meeting, so be thankful.</span></p>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all have weekend projects waiting to get done, so take advantage of those extra hours in the morning! </span>",

            "body_html": "<p>Whether you sleep sprawled out on your back or curled up in a little ball, the position you sleep in can affect the quality of your sleep. Sleep position can play a role in snoring, heartburn, and even wrinkles. And some positions are better than others (sorry, stomach sleepers!) </p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Back Sleepers</span> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Sleeping on your back is great for the spine and neck because the back is straight and not forced into any contortions. In an ideal world, you'd sleep on your back without any pillows, as this position leaves the neck in a neutral position. Back sleeping also has its cosmetic benefits. Spending all night with your face in the air, as opposed to smooshed into a pillow, leads to fewer facial wrinkles. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong> For those who snore or suffer from sleep apnea, sleeping on your back will enhance this. Lying on your back causes the back of the tongue to collapse into the airway, which obstructs breathing and creates those beautiful snoring sounds. Doctors suggest side sleeping for people with sleep apnea. </p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Side Sleepers</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Sleeping on the side is the most common sleep position for a reason. If you are a side sleeper, you should definitely sleep on the left side. It alleviates acid reflux and heartburn, boosts digestion, stimulates the drainage of toxins from the lymph nods, improves circulation, and helps your brain filter out waste. Due to anatomy and the location of your body's organs, these amazing benefits only come from sleeping on the left side. </p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.healthylifetricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/sleeping-on-the-left-side.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"489\" height=\"261\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Sleeping on the left side can put pressure on the stomach and lungs, so it's best to switch it up. Most notably, side sleepers may experience that dreaded arm numbness from resting on a single arm for too long. Finally, this position puts a lot of stress on the shoulders so if you have shoulder pain, you should not sleep on your side. </p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Stomach</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Stomach sleeping eases snoring, but that's about it. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Sleeping on your stomach is probably the worst sleeping position, especially if you have back problems. It flattens the natural curve of the spine, which can lead to lower back pain. Plus, sleeping all night with your head turned to one side will strain the neck. If you do prefer this position, try sticking a pillow under the hips and lower abdomen to give the bottom of the spine a lift. </p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Bottom Line</span></p>\r\n<p>Sleeping is a personal experience, so you should sleep in whichever position is the comfiest for you. If you do suffer from back pain or snore frequently, try switching up your position. It may make a huge difference. The key takeaway is to continue doing what feels right, but if you just ate a huge meal, definitely sleep on your left side! </p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Basking in the sun all day is great, but no one wants to be baking in their bed at night. Many people have trouble sleeping when it's too hot outside. If the AC isn't cooling you down enough at night (the ideal room temperature is 65-68 degrees Fahrenheit), you may want to read these tips below. </p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Go cotton </strong></p>\n<p>Sheets with natural fibers, like cotton, are the best at keeping you cool at night. Although luxurious high-thread-count sheets sound enticing, the National Sleep Foundation recommends a thread count of 200 to 400. It turns out, the tighter the weave, the less breathable the sheets will be. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> </p>\n<p><strong>2. Switch off</strong></p>\n<p>Electrical sockets give off a surprising amount of heat. Turning off all the plug sockets can help reduce excess heat (and will save energy!) </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>3. Stay low</strong></p>\n<p>Remember, heat rises. If you can't get comfortable in your bed, sleep on the floor or downstairs. Maybe better, try a <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">mattress with dynamic cooling</a> - they can go as low as 55 degrees Fahrenheit!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>4. Close your curtains</strong></p>\n<p>If there's a heat wave, it is important to close your curtains and blinds during the day. This is pretty self-explanatory, but blocking light from coming in can help keep your room from overheating. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>5. Rinse your wrists</strong></p>\n<p>Washing your wrists with cold water or rubbing them with an ice cube before you hit the hay can help you cool down. Cooling your pulse points gradually cools you down by slowing the blood to that area of your body, thus stopping your body from overheating. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>6. Watch what you drink</strong></p>\n<p>Boozing before bed is never a good idea, but you should especially avoid it on hot summer nights. Alcohol disrupts sleep and dehydrates. When it's unbearable hot out, it is imperative that you stay hydrated. Keep a cold glass of water by your bed. A cold sip can work wonders when you're overheating. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>7. Take a cold shower</strong></p>\n<p>If you can't bring town the temperature in your room, bring down your body temperature. Taking a cold shower will help drop your body temp a few degrees. Slipping into bed when you're nice and clean will also help you drift off to sleep.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8. Go solo</strong></p>\n<p>Sorry lovebirds, but sleeping with a partner will increase the overall heat in your bed. If you're sleeping alone, try snoozing in the spread eagle position, which is best for reducing body heat and letting air circulate around the body. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Summer heatwaves can significantly disrupt sleep. At Eight Sleep, we aim to help you sleep better, even in the hottest weather. If you have a Nest thermometer, connect it with your Eight app and set your room to the best temperature for your sleep. </p>",

According to a recent article in </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissathompson/2017/05/22/increase-employee-productivity-with-this-one-sleep-hack/2/#10c2ea281a01\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forbes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “Constant light has not only disrupted our natural circadian rhythms, there’s also a surplus of evidence that suggests different types of light can disrupt our natural sleep-wake cycles, our ability to focus, and cause irritability or even depression.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one wants unfocused workers, so what’s a boss to do? Well, changing the lighting in the office can increase productivity. Most office lighting is harsh, often fluorescent lighting. They emit a limited light spectrum that messes with our natural circadian rhythm. People need natural light from the sun to stay healthy and focused, not hours of artifical one tone light.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissathompson/2017/05/22/increase-employee-productivity-with-this-one-sleep-hack/2/#10c2ea281a01\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forbes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there are two types of lighting systems that can improve circadian rhythms and help workers focus more: </span><a href=\"https://www.halcyon-lighting.co.uk/pages/circadian-lighting\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Circadian lighting </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><a href=\"https://energy.gov/energysaver/daylighting\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daylighting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><b>Circadian Lighting</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It imitates natural daylight and follows the transition of the sun from blue light in the early morning to white light in the afternoon. The white light will signal to your body that it is daytime, and it will increase alertness.</span></p>\n<p><b>Daylighting</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This lighting system optimizes natural light that is already entering the room. This system must integrated lights in the room with shades on the window to ensure the proper spectrum of light enters the room.</span></p>\n<p><b>Work with what ya got</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your office building already has plenty of natural light, then there is no need to implement these systems. But if not, figure out which type of lighting is best for your building. If your building does not have a lot of large windows, then use Circadian Lighting. If your building has windows that only a bit of natural light filters through, Daylighting is the best option.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By utilizing one of these two lighting methods, not only will your employees be much more focused, but you’ll save money on electricity by utilizing as much natural light as possible.</span></p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of our body’s natural functions are connected, and they are all influenced by light. Healthy circadian rhythms can not only improve sleep, but they can improve productivity as well.  </span>",

However, vacation also means a new sleeping environment. Many of us experience difficulties sleeping away from home, but there are measures you can take to ensure a poor night’s sleep doesn’t ruin your trip.</span></p>\n<p><b>Consistency is key</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you’re staying at a hotel or with a friend, </span><b>make your room feel like home</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Pack your favorite slippers, your pillowcase, sleepy time socks, and a picture of your family for the nightstand to make you feel comfortable enough to get a good night’s sleep. If you have a bedtime routine such as drinking tea before bed, make sure to continue that routine while you’re away. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Used to a calming scent before bed? Pack those essential oils! </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over time, our bodies associate sleep with our nighttime rituals, so taking away those rituals for a week makes it harder for us to fall asleep.</span></p>\n<p><b>Eating meals at the same time every day</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while on vacation can also help your body get into a natural rhythm. Avoid large meals close to bed so you can fall asleep easily and stay asleep.</span></p>\n<p><b>Adjust sleep schedules</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re traveling to a different time zone, try to adjust to the new timezone by going to sleep when it is nighttime rather than when you start feeling tired. This will help you adjust to the new time zone so you spend enough time awake during the day to enjoy yourself.</span></p>\n<p><b>Location, location, location</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scoping out the location of where you’ll be staying ahead of time can help ensure a more restful sleep. Is it by a busy road? If you’re staying at a hotel, ask to change rooms if you’re on a noisy ground level. No matter where you’re staying, it’s smart to pack ahead with ear buds and a sleep mask.</span></p>\n<p><b>Minimize anxiety</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relax before bed with a spa treatment or warm bath. Eight’s app features relaxing meditation sessions you can listen to before bed. Writing out the next day's activities and/or discussing them with your travel partners so you don’t have to worry about when you’re doing what the next day is also helpful. If you find yourself feeling uncomfortable in your new environment, read a favorite book or listen to some music before bed to relax yourself.</span></p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enjoy every minute of your vacation this summer, asleep and awake, by following these sleep tips. </span>",

Get the most out of your summer by relaxing in the warm weather in these outdoor spots.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Hammocks</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it’s gently swaying under the shade of a palm tree in Mexico or under your grandparent's oak tree in Michigan, laying in a hammock is a relaxing way to get some rest.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Local parks </b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Live in more of an urban jungle than a beach paradise? Not to worry. Grab a shady spot and set up a blanket in your local park if the summer sounds of pickup soccer games lull you to sleep. Not comfy laying on a blanket on the ground? Stack some pillows or bring your own hammock to tie between two trees for an afternoon nap.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Balconies or porches</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether in a hotel or on your own porch, you can catch some rays and zzz’s from the comfort of your own space. The best perk of this spot? You can always walk back in to refill that lemonade.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Beaches</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lull of waves put many people to sleep.

Enjoy the view but escape the noise of below by napping on a rooftop. The best part?

Use sunscreen before napping and insect repellent so you wake up looking and feeling good.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out more about the benefits of napping </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/the-pros-and-cons-of-napping\">here.</a></span></p>",

            "body_html": "<p>Summer holiday weekends in the USA typically consist of backyard barbecues, ice cold booze, and a lot of red white and blue. The extended weekend is a nice break, but staying up late and sleeping in can disrupt our regular sleep schedules.</p>\n<p>We’ve all been there: disrupted sleep, forgotten diet, and the rest of the week looming in front of us. Here’s how to get back on track after the long weekend.</p>\n<h2>Think positively</h2>\n<p>Don’t get discouraged if you can’t fall asleep right away. Believe your sleep will get back on track. Focus on relaxing, but don’t obsess over it. Try not to relive the excitement of the weekend in your mind, but instead try a calming activity like reading to help you fall asleep.</p>\n<h2>Hydrate</h2>\n<p>Those alcoholic watermelon coolers may have sounded great this weekend, but now you’re regretting them. Wake up feeling refreshed by drinking water before bed to prevent thirst and dehydration disrupting sleep. Make sure to hydrate when you wake up as well.</p>\n<h2>Routine, routine, routine</h2>\n<p>It’s important to get back to your normal routine as quickly as possible.</p>\n<h3>Time your meals</h3>\n<p>Over the weekend, eat that burger early between 6-8. Heavy meals close to bedtime can disrupt sleep. But don’t fret if your mealtimes were out of whack over the weekend. To get back on track, try to eat at the same time every day. This will not only help with portion control, but it can help you sleep better. Our bodies’ routines are all connected, so if one thing is off then it can affect something else.</p>\n<h3>Wake up and go to bed at the same time</h3>\n<p>Most of us tend to stay up later when we know there’s no work the next day. However, this can harm our sleep schedules and make it more difficult to wake up and fall asleep during the week. Try to stick to a strict bedtime and wake up time, and don’t stray from it more than a half hour. Eight’s Smart Alarm on the Eight app can help with this. It wakes you up during your lightest sleep stage within a half hour of you alarm. The Eight app can also tell you when it’s time to go to sleep.</p>\n<p>Follow these few simple tips, and you’ll be back to your well rested self in no time!</p>",

A recent study, published in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/articles/28412762/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medical Science Monitor</a>, found a strong link between how much sleep men were getting and how healthy (and abundant) their sperm were. </p>\r\n<p>The study showed that those falling asleep between 8 and 10 pm had the best sperm motility, meaning the sperm are better swimmers and have a greater chance of fertilizing an egg. Men who go to bed after midnight had the worst sperm motility.</p>\r\n<p>Staying up that extra hour to watch one more episode of <em>House Of Cards</em> has a significant impact on your sperm's health. However, don't go thinking you can just sleep an extra hour to reverse the effects. The study also showed that lying in bed for more than nine hours lowers sperm motility. Nonetheless, men who went to bed after midnight AND got less than 6 hours of sleep saw the lowest sperm counts and sperm survival rates. </p>\r\n<p>Going to bed super late and not getting enough sleep can cause your body to release anti-sperm antibodies (ASA) - a type of protein produced by the immune system which can destroy healthy sperm. In fact, a previous study found that men who get six or less hours of sleep had sperm counts 25% lower than those who slept a full eight hours. </p>\r\n<p>If you needed another reason why sufficient sleep is so important, here you go!

            "body_html": "<p>There's a reason why Monday mornings have such a bad rap, and it all has to do with your body's clock. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/l46Cbqvg6gxGvh2PS/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The weekend may be fun and relaxing, but it can wreak havoc on your sleep. Staying up later and sleeping in until noon disrupts your sleep schedule and throws your internal clock off. This makes it much harder to fall asleep on Sunday night, which then gives you a case of the \"Monday Blues.\" According to a recent survey by <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yougov</a> on behalf of Calm.com, of 4,279 Americans and Brits polled online in 2017, a full 23% reported that Sunday night was the most difficult night to fall asleep. </p>\n<p>Sunday night insomnia is actually due to jet lag, or what experts are calling \"social jet lag.\" When you've been going to bed and waking up at different hours than usual, your body just can't adjust properly. You eat on a different schedule on the weekends, exercise differently, and get light exposure later -- all of this delays the circadian rhythm. </p>\n<p>To get back on track, here are some tips to make Monday morning great again: </p>\n<p>1. <strong>Get a good night's sleep each night during the week</strong>: You don't want to head into the weekend feeling sleep deprived. If you get a solid 7-8 hours each night during the week, a weekend deficit will be easier to handle. </p>\n<p>2. <strong>Avoid sleeping in on Saturdays and Sundays</strong>: This one may be tough, but you'll thank us later. If you wake up at the same time every day, including weekends, you will become a much better sleeper. </p>\n<p>3. <strong>Take a short nap</strong>: If you stayed out 'til 3 AM, you'll probably require a nap. The key is to nap before 2 PM and limit it to 20-30 minutes so it won't mess with your sleep at night. </p>\n<p>4. <strong>Soak up the sun</strong>: Get us much sun as possible in the morning. If the weather permits, go outside. If not, open your curtains or eat breakfast by the window. Light helps keep your circadian rhythm in check and it lowers melatonin levels. Being more awake and alert during the day will help you feel tired come nighttime. </p>\n<p>5. <strong>Choose one night for booze</strong>: As you know, alcohol negatively affects sleep, so try and limit your intake on the weekends. If you want to party, choose one night of the weekend instead of both. Friday nights are probably better so that you get all of Saturday and Sunday to recover. </p>\n<p>6. <strong>Reduce anxiety</strong>: Another reason for Sunday night sleeping troubles is workweek anxieties. Whether you're worrying about that meeting with your boss or that big deal you have to close, work can be extremely stressful. Try to write down everything you have to that week on a piece of paper before going to bed. This way, these intrusive thoughts won't be bothering you while you're trying to fall asleep. </p>\n<p>Mondays are hard, which is why we at Eight want to create the best sleeping environment for you. Our smart alarm detects when you're in your lightest stage of sleep, so waking up is easier. <a href=\"eightsleep.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Start sleeping smart today</a>. </p>",

In fact, just a few nights of restricted sleep is enough to make a person look \"significantly\" more ugly. In the Stockholm University experiment, 25 participants were photographed after 2 days of sleep restriction and after normal sleep. Then, strangers rated whether they'd socialize with the participant in the photo. They also rated participants' attractiveness, health, sleepiness and trustworthiness. </p>\n<p>The results showed that when sleep deprived, the participants were perceived to be less attractive, less healthy, more sleepy - and the raters were less inclined to socialize with them.</p>\n<p>The researchers explained this in evolutionary terms saying, \"an unhealthy-looking face, whether due to sleep deprivation or otherwise, might active disease-avoiding mechanisms in others.\" In other words, people don't like to hang out with people who look sick. </p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p>Physical attractiveness can affect the way we perceive and treat an individual. Psychologists call this the physical attractiveness stereotype, which is the tendency to assume that people who are attractive possess socially desirable traits. According to various studies, beautiful people are viewed as healthier, more intelligent, and more likable. For example, facial symmetry, a universal sign of beauty, is often perceived as a sign of health, and <a href=\"http://psych.colorado.edu/~munakata/teaching/prosem05/ProkoschEtAl05.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">general intelligence</a> is positively linked to body symmetry. </p>\n<p>There's a reason why being tired makes you look, well, ugly. Dark circles and bags appear when the body is unable to rejuvenate at night due to lack of sleep. When you sleep, you distribute water in the body. Not getting enough sleep causes water to accumulate under the eyes. Stress, which is linked to lack of sleep, is what really beats you up. When you're tired and stressed, you lose collagen, which makes your face baggy, produces less melanin (making you paler), and leads to wrinkles. </p>\n<p>Stay beautiful by sleeping smart with Eight.

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweating at night can be embarrassing and uncomfortable. It can also lead to an awful lot of laundry days for all those sweat-drenched clothes. So why do some people tend to sweat during the night?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s start with the basics. Sweating is our bodies’ natural way to cool us down and prevent overheating. There are many possible causes of sweating at night, some more serious than others. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><b>Moderate and/or not sweating every night</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you moderately sweat during the night, it may simply be a sign that your sleeping environment is too warm. Lower the temperature in your room at night or the temperature of your bed with the Eight app. The ideal bedroom temperature is 65-68 degrees Fahrenheit. Opening the windows for a breeze if you don’t suffer from allergies or turning a fan on could also help alleviate some sweat.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One major culprit to bed-sweaters is the mattress you’re sleeping on. Certain designs trap in heat and moisture, which prevents your body from regulating its temperature like it wants to. Sleeping hot is one of the biggest complaints from memory foam mattresses, which is why we created something better. <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">The Pod by Eight Sleep</a> offers dynamic cooling paired with premium breathable foam layers. The result is a cool and comfortable mattress for you to sleep on all summer long.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another obvious fix is to sleep in breathable sheets.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ﻿﻿</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applying deodorant before bed can also aid in reducing sweat at night. Since sweating is our bodies’ way of telling us we’re getting too hot, make sure to drink a glass of water before bed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides a high room temperature, a number of medications also have side effects that include sweating at night, so make sure to read the label on your pills. Additionally, low blood sugar can cause sweating at night.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><b>Excessive sweating nightly or almost every night</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find yourself sweating excessively every night, then it could be a sign of something more serious like tuberculosis, HIV, or sleep apnea among other things. Menopause and pregnancy can also cause women to sweat excessively during the night. Consult your doctor for treatment options.</span></p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can try our Eight Smart Mattress for 108 nights to see for yourself how cool it sleeps. </span>",

When you exercise, your body temperature increases. So after exercising, your body temperature decreases which can induce sleep. But if you try to go to bed too quickly after exercising, usually within an hour and a half, your heart rate and temperature could still be up, which often makes it difficult to fall and stay asleep. Everyone is unique, so if you find that exercise before bed does not affect your sleep, then drop and give me 20!  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always make sure to do cool down stretches after exercising as this can help relax you and make it easier to fall asleep.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While exercise certainly affects sleep, the results may not be felt immediately. In many </span><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sleep-newzzz/201309/better-sleep-found-exercising-regular-basis-0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">studies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it took weeks, sometime even months, before exercisers reported better sleep.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While exercise’s effect on sleep is not immediate, the effects of sleep on exercise are. Sleep and exercise have a two way relationship; not getting a good night’s sleep can negatively impact your workout the following day.</span></p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bottom line is that exercise is just as important as sleep in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So stick with it! </span>",

But how safe is it to fall asleep in the sun?</p>\n<p>From a sleep point of view, there are many benefits of naps. They can relax you and give you more energy. But staying in the sun too long can leave you feeling tired, taking away many benefits of napping.  </p>\n<p>If you’re going to be out in the sun anyway, it’s fine to take a short nap as long as you have a person or alarm to wake you up so you don’t sleep too long and burn.  Normally, the ideal nap should be 15-35 minutes or a full 90 minutes. Otherwise, you’ll wake up feeling groggy. But your sun siesta should not last longer than a half hour. Why?  Laying in the sun can cause dehydration, and going over an hour without water in the hot sun can be unsafe. You should also check every half hour to see if you need to apply more sunscreen. Take it from someone who has woken up looking like a tomato too many times: always apply sunscreen that is at least 20 SPF before you nap.</p>\n<p>Remember that UV rays are highest from <a href=\"http://www.sunsafetyalliance.org/uv_rays.html\">10am-4pm</a>, and the sun gets harsher throughout the day. So an early morning nap or a sunset snooze are best. Be sure to wear sunglasses or put a shirt or towel over your face to protect your eyes from the sun as well.</p>\n<p>Nap smart and safely this summer by following these tips.</p>",

With all the recent advancements in technology, it’s no wonder that our homes can be smarter than us. Add in the Eight Smart Bed, and your home will be the smartest one on the block.</p>\n<p>There are a number of benefits that come with owning a smart home.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest upsides of having a smart home is that <strong>you can connect all your devices to one another easily. </strong>This is usually done using <a href=\"https://content.eightsleep.com/2017/04/06/what-is-ifttt/\">IFTTT</a>, a free app and website that allows you to connect all of your smart technology and apps.  Never thought your bed could make your coffee? The future is here, friends.</p>\n<p>Another major perk of smart homes? <strong>You can control everything from one place</strong>: your smartphone. You don’t have to worry about learning any new, complicated controls. Controlling your smart home with the tap of a finger makes owning a smart home <strong>easy and convenient.</strong></p>\n<p>Smart homes can also <strong>save you time</strong>. Connecting your Eight Smart Bed to your WeMo coffeemaker for example can save you time in the morning. Let your smart devices do the work for you.</p>\n<p>Everything is uniquely fit for your lifestyle so you get your money’s worth on all of your products. Smart homes also <strong>save you money</strong> by automatically turning devices and lights off when they are not being used or when the room is empty.  </p>\n<p>Since they save energy and don’t waste electricity, smart homes are also <strong>efficient and good for the planet.</strong> The Eight Smart Bed connects with Nest thermostat to automatically adjust to your optimal room temperature for sleeping, so your heating or cooling system doesn’t run more than you need. Since Eight Smart Beds also have a warming system, you can turn your bedroom heat off in the winter.</p>\n<p>From shutting off the stove to locking doors to making sure your bed warming does not stay on too long, smart homes look out for you. They are <strong>safer than traditional homes.</strong> </p>\nSmart homes are the smart choice, and no smart home is complete without a smart bed.

But why do some of us toss and turn nearly every night?</p>\n<p>The Eight app uses data from the sensors in the Sleep Tracker to tell you how much you toss and turn each night. If you toss and turn for a minute, it is recorded. Anything under a minute is not recorded because it does not significantly impact sleep. In the past week alone, the average person tossed and turned 37-40 times each night.  </p>\n<h2>Causes</h2>\n<p>If you find yourself constantly moving during the night, alcohol or evening coffee may be the cause. Alcohol and caffeine before bed can lead to a restless sleep. Another possibility is that your bedroom is too warm or there is too much light in it.</p>\n<p>Pain can also make it difficult to sleep, so if you’re experiencing chronic pain in any part of your body, it may be the reason you’re tossing and turning so much.</p>\n<p>Other possible culprits? Restless leg syndrome or s<a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/why-stomach-sleeping-is-a-major-pain\">leeping on your stomach</a>. Stomach sleeping can lead to neck and back pain that causes tossing and turning.</p>\n<p>Everyday worrying can also lead to feeling restless at night. However, tossing and turning could be the result of something more serious, like sleep apnea or depression. Consult your doctor if you have serious concerns.</p>\n<p>Tossing and turning can lead to an interrupted sleep and not enough time spent in deep sleep. You can wake up feeling like you didn’t sleep at all. There are a number of steps you can take to reduce the amount of time you spend tossing and turning each night.</p>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<p>Start with these easy fixes if you’re not sure the reason for your restless sleep.</p>\n<p>-Avoid alcohol and caffeine after early afternoon</p>\n<p>-Monitor the temperature of your bed and bedroom.

            "body_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can’t be argued that a night’s sleep is an important time for our bodies to recover and re-energize. That being said, most of us have different sleep experiences each night, and as a result, may wake up still feeling tired, or if we’re lucky, will open our eyes feeling energetic and ready for the day. Most people would attribute the quality of their rest to what kind of sleeper they are. This brings us to light sleepers vs. deep sleepers. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ve probably heard of self-proclaimed “light sleepers” being awoken by the faintest noise</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or experiencing sleepless nights from difficulty falling asleep. Meanwhile, proclaimed deep sleepers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">could sleep through a screaming baby using a jackhammer. But everyone experiences both light and deep sleep</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in their circadian rhythm</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So what </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does this mean and what </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exactly is the difference </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">between the two</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Light sleep and deep sleep are two different stages of sleep that everyone experiences. Each sleep stage serves an important role in regulating your circadian rhythm so that you will feel well-rested in the morning. Additionally, each stage has an effect on your dreams, overall brain function, and repairs your body for the next day. Read on to learn more about light and deep sleep and what happens during each stage. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><b>LIGHT SLEEP</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Light sleep is a non-REM stage, and it’s easiest to wake up during this stage. It occurs in stages 1-2. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Light sleep may not sound very important, but it is a part of our sleep cycle that we need to wake up feeling refreshed. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first stage of light sleep is a transition phase and only makes up about</span><a href=\"https://www.tuck.com/light-sleep/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 3% </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of our total time asleep; most light sleep happens in the second stage. The second stage of light sleep consists of over half of our time asleep each night. We </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are able to fall asleep and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dream during this stage, but the dreams are not as intense as they are during REM sleep.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically as people age, they spend more time each night in light sleep. There </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> no specific amount of time needed in this phase since it’s not as refreshing as deep sleep. However, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">light sleep</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">still</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a necessary sleep stage for proper brain functioning.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><b>DEEP SLEEP</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sleepless-in-america/201010/the-mysterious-benefits-deep-sleep\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychology Today</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> defines deep sleep as “... a time of nearly complete disengagement from the environment.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A deeper</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sleep is also known as delta sleep, slow wave sleep or N3. It is a restorative sleep state where dreams do not occur, and still relatively little is known about it.  What we do know is that deep sleep is the third stage of sleep. During this stage, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">heart rate and breathing slow </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">down</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and your muscles relax to the point where you barely move. Deep sleep is necessary for your body </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and skin</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to repair itself and recharge for the next day. Your organs detoxicate, your kidneys clean your blood, and your body replaces cells, heals wounds, and builds muscle tissues as well. Most deep sleep happens in the first sleep cycle. If someone is </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">woken up</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during deep sleep, he or she will usually feel disoriented for sometime after waking up. It can be very difficult to wake a person during deep sleep</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> levels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><a href=\"http://www.newhealthadvisor.com/How-Much-Deep-Sleep-Do-You-Need.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New Health Advisor</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, adults 18 and older need anywhere from 1.5-1.8 hours of deep sleep per night, which is about 20% of your overall sleep. Some people, however, may find they need more in order to feel fully rested</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and consider it a good night’s sleep</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there’s no such thing as too much deep sleep.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding light sleep and deep sleep and how long you are in each stage every night can be helpful for you to monitor your sleep patterns. Monitoring this can be useful for your nightly recovery so that you always wake up feeling well-rested and ready to conquer your day.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to understand how much deep and light sleep you </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">re getting </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">but are unsure how to keep track</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?

Read below for tips to sleep soundly this allergy season. </p>\n<p><b>Tip #1:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Use a nasal rinse before bed since allergies can worsen during the night and prevent a good night’s rest.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tip #2:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Make sure to clean or change the filter in your air conditioning units. If your air conditioner’s filter goes unchecked for long periods of time, dust that triggers allergies can accumulate. </span></p>\n<p><b>Tip #3:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Consider closing the windows. Cracking your windows to let in a breeze can be a nice alternative to air conditioning in the warmer months. But if you find that too much pollen accumulates in your room, consider closing the window a few hours before bedtime. </span></p>\n<p><b>Tip #4:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Don’t put the clothes you were wearing outside during the day on your bed. Pollen and other particles can cling to them and potentially transfer over to your sheets. This can trigger allergies that make sleeping difficult.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tip #5: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turn your humidifier off to prevent the air from being too moist. Too much moisture and humidity can </span><a href=\"http://pingi.com/the-10-must-knows-about-moisture-problems/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">potentially lead to allergies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and worsening of asthma-related breathing issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allergies no doubt cause sleep disruptions. By using the Sleep Tracker with the Eight App, you'll be able to see how long you were up at night because of allergies and how much you tossed and turned.

While there are a number of uncontrollable factors that affect sleep, luckily one of the most important ones is something we  can control: temperature.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Temperature</h2>\n<p>Keep it cool. For a restful, uninterrupted sleep, your body should be anywhere from<a href=\"http://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/health/advice/a2364/how-temperature-affects-your-sleep/\"> 65-72 degrees Fahrenheit. </a> If your body heats up too much during the night, you won’t be able to sleep well. Adjust the temperature in your bedroom to the cooler side, around 65 degrees Fahrenheit. The Eight Sleep App lets you monitor this; it tells you the temperature of your bed and bedroom so you can adjust it accordingly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Sleepwear</h2>\n<p>Ditch the sleepy time socks since they increase body temperature to uncomfortable degrees. During the summer, the less clothes you wear, the better. If you’re not one to embrace the birthday suit, wear thin, cotton pajamas, preferably shorts and a tank top.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Mattress</h2>\n<p>If you’re a notorious bed sweater, it might not be your fault! Your bed could be the problem. Consider investing in a mattress that will help you stay cool at night. <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">Eight’s innovative smart bed</a> is designed to keep you cool. The reactive top layer of foam allows for optimal airflow and breathability, while the Active Grid dynamically cools to as low as 55 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Pillow and Sheets</h2>\n<p>Investing in thin, breathable cotton sheets will allow you to sleep through the night without sweating.  If you find you’re sleeping warm, your pillow could also be a culprit. Some memory foam pillows tend to trap heat, so consider investing in a more breathable one.</p>\n<p>Staying cool will help you get your best slumber yet.</p>",

            "created_at": "2017-05-09T11:43:16-04:00",
            "body_html": "<p>Memorial Day is an American holiday that honors fallen soldiers, so why has it become ubiquitous with mattress sales? Well, it doesn't take much to turn a national holiday into a consumer holiday. Although most people have the day off, retailers stay open. Everyday is a potential sale for a retail company, and holidays present the greatest opportunity for profit and growth. A <a href=\"https://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/Infographic%3A+What+Will+Consumers+Be+Buying+This+Memorial+Day+Weekend%3F/10580018.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Goodshop</a> survey found that 53% of consumers who plan to shop on Memorial Day will be looking for sales, both online and in-store. Because over half of Americans are looking to shop, it makes sense that a Memorial Day sale will be a boon for business. </p>\n<p>Long weekend holidays like Memorial Day, President's Day, and Labor Day have historically been the best for high-ticket items like mattresses. Most mattresses range from $800-$1200. This kind of pricey purchase is not an impulse buy. A three-day weekend allows consumers to think before they buy.  A mattress is a product that people interact with every day - it's an important part of life! Before e-commerce became big, people would use their three-day weekend to go to a mattress store and shop. Having this extra day gave someone and their significant other a chance to check out the mattress together. Now that online mattress companies like Eight exist, you can skip the store and <a href=\"eightsleep.com\">buy online</a>. This will give you ample time to enjoy the barbecues and the beach. </p>\n<p>Another reason why Memorial Day is such a big weekend for mattress sales is because Memorial Day is the unofficial start of summer. School is out and the sun is out. The warmer weather signals rest and relaxation. People tend to view the summer as vacation. They believe they have more time to sleep, hence why everyone is thinking about mattresses at the end of May. </p>\n<p>Summer is also a primetime for moving. According to real estate figures, most Americans move between May and September. Nobody wants to move when it's cold out, and the nicer weather makes lugging boxes back and fourth easier and more enjoyable. People also move more in the summer due to summer internships and new jobs after graduation. Recent college grads will be moving out of their home and looking to furnish their new apartment. In addition, many newlyweds will be moving into a new home together during the summer months because summer season is wedding season. When a person relocates, they usually buy new furniture. Don't worry about struggling to fit your huge mattress through your door! Get one <a href=\"eightsleep.com\">shipped in a box</a> from Eight. </p>\n<p>Lastly, May marks a rise of consumer spending. According to a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/07/14/americans-are-spending-more-money-this-summer-but-not-on-fun-stuff/?utm_term=.9a0f6f387e8f\">Gallup survey</a>, Americans start spending more money in the summer. The average dollar amount continues to increase until the winter holidays. Then there is a significant drop off after January. Perhaps it is the Memorial Day Weekend sales that spark these spending trends. In fact, most sales actually begin a few weeks before the holiday. This Memorial Day, you can get <strong>$150 off any mattress at Eight</strong>, free shipping and returns! </p>",

            "body_html": "<p>In honor of National Teacher Appreciation Week, we decided to examine how being a teacher can affect sleep. </p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://cms.bsu.edu/news/articles/2008/9/study-finds-that-teachers-are-fighting-to-stay-awake-in-the-classroom\">study</a> by Ball State University found that 43% of teachers slept 6 hours or less a night, and 64% reported feeling drowsy during school hours. The study is from 2008, and with all the new curriculum requirements added in many schools since then, sleep deprivation could be worse by now.  Our educators teach us many valuable lessons, but are they learning how to properly sleep?</p>\n<p>The majority of teachers don’t stop working at the end of the school day.  Classes may end at 3pm, but teachers work well into the night.  They must attend after school meetings, plan lessons, and grade papers, not to mention deal with their own personal lives and obligations. These responsibilities are nearly constant, and it’s no wonder many teachers don’t have time to sleep the recommended eight hours at night.</p>\n<p>Besides staying up late, many teachers also wake up before the sun in order to get to work on time.  </p>\n<p>Teachers work hard for their students, but the fact is a tired teacher is not a great teacher. People are more likely to make mistakes when they are sleep deprived. Teachers getting more rest will not only benefit their students, but it is important for their own health as well. According to <a href=\"http://www.healthline.com/health/sleep-deprivation/effects-on-body\">Healthline</a>, “Sleep deprivation can lead to [a] higher risk of chronic health problems like high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.”</p>\n<p>Dealing with a room full of kids is a hard enough task when you’re well rested, so don’t let a lack of sleep make it even more exhausting.</p>\n<iframe src=\"//giphy.com/embed/sW6P26sp3HFvy\" width=\"480\" height=\"197\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/ferris-buellers-day-off-bueller-sW6P26sp3HFvy\">via GIPHY</a></p>\n<p>While the amount of work will likely not dwindle, there are steps you can take as a teacher to sleep better. It can be tempting to drink that coffee at night to help you focus on grading, but <strong>avoid caffeine</strong> before bed as it disrupts sleep. Another trick? <strong>Stick to a regular sleep schedule.</strong> You make your students follow a class schedule, so lead by example. It can be daunting thinking of all the young futures you're shaping, so to avoid worrying keeping you up at night, <strong>try a warm bath</strong> before bed to relax. If you don't already do so, <strong>staying organized</strong> with a weekly planner can help manage your workload so it doesn't keep you up as much at night. </p>\n<p> </p>\nThis Teacher Appreciation week, consider swapping that apple for your teacher with a sleep mask.",

            "body_html": "<p>Sleep deprivation is an inevitable part of having children, and it has long been assumed that mothers carry the brunt of this exhaustion. From cradling her baby boy to sleep to lying awake worrying about her teenage son's whereabouts, mothers definitely lose sleep over their children. With this hypothesis in mind, we set out to find out what being a mother actually does to your sleep. We conducted a survey paired with true sleep data analysis in order to prove whether parenthood affects sleep or not, and if it does to what extent. </p>\n<p>Our analysis found that on average, moms are faced with the most sleep challenges including more frequent interruptions and trouble falling asleep. In addition, <strong>only 13% of women with children rate their sleep as good, compared to 46% of fathers. </strong></p>\n<p>Parents ages 25 and up living in the U.S. were surveyed about their sleep habits and patterns, and were asked to rate the quality of their sleep. We analyzed these responses in correlation to the sleep data collected from our Sleep Tracker and Smart Mattress, which measures over 12 sleep data points including sleep times, toss and turns, and deep and light sleep. </p>\n<p>Although the data showed that women sleep more than men, mothers experience greater sleep challenges. Moms frequently reported having trouble falling asleep, with 10% saying they have trouble \"always\" and 16% \"often\" - compared to 7% and 12% respectively for dads. Women with children also report getting up in the middle of the night more often than men with children. In families where children wake up in the night, mothers' sleep suffers more than that of dads' with their amount of deep sleep decreasing considerably. A healthy person's deep sleep range per night is 18 to 25%. Moms with children who wake up twice per night present a lower average than dads in the same situation: 21% vs 24%. </p>\n<p>Mothers may sleep longer (7 hours 34 minutes compared to 7 hours 17 minutes for fathers), but that doesn't mean they are getting a good night's sleep. The old saying quality over quantity rings true. A mom whose sleep is disrupted during the night may not get enough full cycles of sleep. This explains why she is less likely to rate her sleep as \"good.\" She probably feels more tired during the day due to the frequent wake-ups and the difficulty falling asleep. </p>\n<p>Help your mom get the best sleep possible this Mother's Day. Don't do something to worry her and make sure she is as comfortable and relaxed as possible. Treat her to a spa day, she deserves it! </p>\n<p>Eight published this research in its first <em>National Sleep Trends Report</em>.

            "body_html": "<p>Cinco De Mayo is the day to commemorate the Mexican army’s victory over the French forces at the Battle of Puebla in 1862. But in America, most people know it as the day to drink discounted margaritas and eat guacamole. But before you dawn a sombrero just yet, consider how these drinks and foods found in classic Mexican dishes like enchiladas and tacos affect your sleep.</p>\n<h2>Beans:</h2>\n<p>Legumes like the black and pinto beans often found in Mexican dishes can help you get a good night’s sleep. Why? They have tryptophan in them, an amino acid that gets converted into melatonin, a hormone that regulates our circadian rhythms.</p>\n<h2>Guacamole:</h2>\n<p>Guac costs extra at Chipotle, but did you know it can help you sleep well? Avocados are high in magnesium, a relaxing mineral that is key in sleep. According to the <a href=\"http://www.alaskasleep.com/blog/foods-for-sleep-list-best-worst-foods-getting-sleep\">Alaska Sleep Clinic</a>, “A lack of magnesium can be directly linked to difficulty going and staying asleep. Magnesium is often referred to as <i>the</i> sleep mineral.”</p>\n<h2>Cheese:</h2>\n<p>Who doesn’t love cheese on their tacos? Even my lactose intolerant self endures the stomach pain for the love of cheese on this holiday. Like beans, cheese also contains tryptophan which induces sleep. So go crazy on the extra cheese this Friday.</p>\n<h2><strong>What to avoid?</strong></h2>\n<h2>Margaritas:</h2>\n<p>Everyone knows by now that alcohol can help you fall asleep, but <a href=\"https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/how-alcohol-affects-sleep\">multiple studies </a>show that it disrupts sleep. This is the case for all alcohol, not just May margs. Maybe think twice before you have that nightcap, and take those tequila shots well before bedtime.</p>\n<p>Most of these staple ingredients in Mexican dishes can actually help you have a better sleep. So happy eating, and happy Cinco de Mayo!</p>",

Workers who were exposed to more sun got more sleep on average, 46 minutes more per night.</p>\n<p>Sun can help us sleep more, but it can also disrupt our natural body clocks. The sun staying out longer makes us want to stay up later. The increased daylight interferes with our circadian rhythms - our body’s natural sleep clock. You can’t dim the sun, but you can <strong>dawn a sleep mask</strong> to block out light and help you fall asleep. Summertime also means more hours of daylight overall, so wearing a sleep mask all night can help block out the early morning sun too.</p>\n<p>Changing your body’s natural sleep cycle each season can make it harder to fall asleep, but going to bed and waking up at roughly the same time year round can help ensure a restful slumber.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://media2.giphy.com/media/l2JdTsDKCQSOkJZoA/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Another summer bummer?

Eight’s 300 thread count cotton bed sheets are the perfect choice for summer nights.  </p>\n<p>We want you to get the most out of your summer, day and night.

It also becomes easier to fall asleep.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So as you’re nodding off studying for your final final this year, remember that soon your slumber will get better.</span></p>\n<iframe src=\"//giphy.com/embed/DMvOJX5R6UvUQ\" width=\"480\" height=\"360.96\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/humphrey-bogart-howard-hawks-the-big-sleep-DMvOJX5R6UvUQ\">via GIPHY</a></p>",

            "body_html": "<p>The consequences of insufficient sleep go beyond next-day drowsiness. Aside from feeling too tired to workout or too out of it to contribute to an important meeting, lack of sleep can also seriously affect your health. It can lead to weight gain, depression, and it may even shrink your brain. Because sleep is so important, we at Eight are dedicated to helping individuals improve their sleep experience. In addition to purchasing a smart bed, there are several other things you can do to help you sleep.</p>\r\n<p>However, we're not going to waste your time by listing the obvious \"no caffeine before bed\" and \"power down your phone before lights-out.\" Instead, we're providing new insights and ideas that will make your sleep as restorative as possible.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Burn energy </strong></p>\r\n<p>To catch more z's, you may need to spend more time at the gym. If you habitually have trouble falling asleep, exercise may be your natural remedy. A study in the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23946713\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine</em></a> found that older adults who suffered from insomnia were able to sleep 45 to 60 minutes longer per night after exercising for at least 30 minutes three times a week. In addition, exercise triggers an increase in body temperature, and the post-exercise drop in temperature may promote falling asleep. Exercising regularly helps ease stress, anxiety and depression—all problems that can interfere with getting a restful night’s sleep.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Block your clock </strong></p>\r\n<p>Do you glance at your clock several times a night? Watching the minutes tick by can stress you out and keep you up at night. A clock serves as a wake signal. Seeing the time heightens your arousal level and dampers your ability to fall asleep. Put your clock out of view or flip over your phone so you don't have the urge to look at the time. </p>\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n<p><strong>3. Get some sunlight</strong> </p>\r\n<p>Researchers actually found that more natural light exposure during the day resulted in more restful sleep at night. Compared with their colleagues who sat by a window, windowless office workers got 46 fewer minutes of sleep per night. <span>Morning sunlight can also boost your daytime energy and your ability to fall asleep. E</span>xposure to light during the day is one critical way that we affect our sleep-wake cycles. Exposure to light and to darkness drives the circadian system, which in turn helps to regulate sleep-wake cycles over the 24-hour day and night. </p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Stop hitting snooze</strong></p>\r\n<p>You may think that hitting snooze one, two, or five times will help you wake up, but it's actually doing the exact opposite. When you fall back asleep for a few minutes, you may slip into a new sleep cycle. When you wake again, you'll feel groggy due to what researchers call sleep inertia, a transitional state between sleep and wakefulness. This impairs things like alertness, memory, and reaction time.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Shoot for the moon </strong></p>\r\n<p>Pay attention to the lunar cycles because the moon may impact your sleep. People have long reported that it's harder to fall asleep or stay asleep during a full moon. <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(14)00543-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Current Biology</em></a> reported that study participants who slept in a completely dark lab got an average of 20 fewer minutes of sleep per night on the days shortly before or after a full moon. They also showed lower levels of melatonin and 30% less EEG activity, which is associated with deep sleep. </p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Sleep comfortably</strong></p>\r\n<p>Besides sleeping on a comfortable and supportive <a href=\"eightsleep.com\">mattress</a>, you should also consider the position you sleep in. If you sleep on your side, make sure to line your nose up with the center of your body. This will prevent that stiff neck in the morning. Try to avoid sleeping on your stomach, because that twists your neck and strains your back. </p>\r\n<p><strong>7. Set your body clock</strong> </p>\r\n<p>Going to sleep and waking up at roughly the same time every day, even on weekends, is important for your sleep. This routine will get your brain and body used to a schedule and will help you sync up with the natural day and night rhythms of the planet. When you go to sleep at the same time every night, your body will start to automatically produce melatonin at that time, and therefore help you nod off more easily. </p>\r\n<p><strong>8. Rethink your drink </strong></p>\r\n<p>Even though that glass of red wine before bed may make you sleepy, it won't help you get a good night's sleep. Alcohol decreases the amount of REM sleep we get, which is vital for memory and concentration. As the alcohol wears off during the second part of the night, sleep is often disrupted, as people frequently wake up. If you're still in search of a \"nightcap\" opt for warm milk or chamomile tea.  </p>\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n<p> </p>",

            "body_html": "<p>When you’re in the market for a new mattress, there are many things to keep in mind before you put down your credit card.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Support</h2>\n<p>Your mattress should offer proper support for your body type.  Does it conform to your body and align your spine correctly? If you feel like you’re sinking into the mattress too much, the body support may be lacking. Eight’s four high density foam layers provide the perfect amount of support.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Pressure point relief</h2>\n<p>Few of us are fortunate enough to not suffer from any consistent aches and pains. From backs to hips, the right mattress can help alleviate pain on those body parts that tend to ache. Innerspring mattresses tend to spring back with force and put pressure on sensitive areas while high quality foam can offer proper pressure point relief. <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">Eight’s mattress </a>contours to your body. It provides support to every inch of your body in the right position, thus helping to provide pressure point relief.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Temperature regulation</h2>\n<p>It is critical to make sure the materials that make up your mattress are breathable. You want proper air flow throughout your mattress so your body temperature is properly regulated. <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">Eight mattresses</a> are designed so you sleep cool, featuring dynamic cooling. Don’t pay money for a mattress that causes you to wake up with cold toes or drenched in sweat in the middle of the night.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Freedom of movement and size</h2>\n<p>No one wants to feel crowded and cramped in their own bed; you get enough of that on your morning commute to work. Don’t spend hundreds on a mattress your feet will hang off of. Make sure the mattress you’re considering offers enough room for you and a partner (if you sleep with one) to move around comfortably in.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Comfort</h2>\n<p>Do you like firm or soft? Firm mattresses are generally preferred by people who need complete support and sleep on their backs. Softer mattresses are usually the choice of people with smaller body frames who don’t need as much support. Eight’s mattress is a 6/10 on the firmness scale; it is not too firm, but not too soft.</p>\n<p>Buying a mattress is a ultimately a personal decision, but these are tips everyone should keep in mind while shopping.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Remember: Try before you buy.</strong> Test out the mattress in store to see if it’s right for your sleeping style. Many online companies offer a trial period where you can return your mattress for free if you don’t love it. Eight has a 100 night trial period, and you can also test out the mattress for yourself at our showroom in New York.

In 1942, the average hours of sleep per night was 7.9. In their recent 2013 poll, the average was 6.8. That’s 40% of Americans sleeping less than 7 hours per night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This overall lack of sleep can not only affect us mentally by putting us in a grouchy morning mood, but it can affect us physically too. A lack of sleep has been shown to cause weight gain. The easiest way to shed those pounds requires no gym membership at all. Research shows that getting enough sleep can actually help you lose weight.</span></p>\n<p><b>The proper amount of sleep is </b><a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/are-you-wasting-your-life-how-many-hours-of-sleep-we-really-need\"><b>about 8 hours</b></a><b> per night. According to </b><a href=\"https://www.rodalewellness.com/weight-loss/6-slimming-sleep-secrets?ocid=Synd_WH_weightloss_slimmingsleepsecrets\"><b>Rodale Wellness</b></a><b>, being well rested can:</b></p>\n<h2><b>Stop late night snacking and drinking</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duh. It doesn’t take an expert to know that the more time spent sleeping, the less time you are awake to possibly be eating. Midnight munching can be tempting, but if you go to sleep while you’re still full, you can avoid those calorie packed chocolate snacks and nighttime nachos. </span></p>\n<iframe src=\"//giphy.com/embed/iV8lQ1lJcp0wE\" width=\"480\" height=\"282.94736842105266\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/food-gif-eating-eat-your-emotions-iV8lQ1lJcp0wE\">via GIPHY</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><b>Help you burn more calories</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’ve had the right amount of sleep, your body is ready to take on the day. You have more energy to go to that morning hot yoga class or on an evening jog that will burn calories. Your body also has more energy to burn the calories you take in during the day faster when you’re well rested. You may not think so, but our bodies actually burn calories when we sleep too. People who sleep well burn more calories while they sleep than people who get less sleep than them.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Increase fat lost</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The less you sleep, the harder it is to drop weight. According to a study </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">published in the </span><a href=\"http://annals.org/aim/article/746253/insufficient-sleep-diet-obesity\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annals of Internal Medicine</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, dieting doesn’t work well when we’re sleep deprived. The study found that a lack of sleep reduced fat loss by 55 percent.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Help you buy healthier food</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about it: when was the last time you were tired and wanted to curl up with a blanket and a bowl of broccoli? When we’re sleep deprived, our bodies tend to crave fatty foods. But when we have the proper amount of rest, our brains function better and we can make smart choices about our food purchases.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Encourage portion control </b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Too little sleep messes with our brain. When we’re tired, we don’t put together balanced, well portioned meals. We also have a tendency to overeat when we’re tired.  Studies have shown that the pleasure seeking part of our brain tends to have more influence when we’re tired, so we eat too much of what isn’t good for us. We can’t make smart eating decisions when our brains are too tired to function.</span></p>\n<iframe src=\"//giphy.com/embed/lzWnRSsKdK1GM\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/food-gif-vegan-lzWnRSsKdK1GM\">via GIPHY</a></p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all want more sleep, and knowing that it can help prevent weight gain is all the more reason to make sure we get it. </span>",

            "body_html": "<p>Most of us are probably aware by now that our beds should only be used for sleeping and love making. In reality, a lot of life happens on the mattress, from beauty rituals, to Wine Wednesdays, to natural bodily functions. And life can be messy.</p>\n<p>That’s why we compiled a list of some common mattress stains and how to remove them. For most of these stains (except nail polish), you can start by trying to remove the stain with soap and water. However, that may only weaken the stain. To get rid of stains for good, try these home remedies.  Keep in mind that it’s always best to treat stains as soon as possible since this increases the likelihood of removing them.</p>\n<h1>Nail Polish</h1>\n<p>There’s no doubt that mattresses make some of the most comfortable places to paint your nails. But sooner or later your nail polish is bound to spill, and the smell of nail polish doesn’t exactly provide a calming aroma for sleep. If the spill seeps into your mattress:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Blot it with a paper towel to remove as much as possible.</li>\n<li>Using a cotton swab or cotton ball, apply nail polish remover to the stained area.</li>\n<li>Use a new paper towel to blot the nail polish remover until it’s dry.</li>\n<li>Pour a little water onto the area with the nail polish remover to get it out.</li>\n<li>Add a spoonful of laundry detergent to ensure the smell goes away.</li>\n<li>Wipe the area with a wet washcloth or sponge.</li>\n<li>Pat it dry.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol></ol>\n<h1>Urine</h1>\n<p>Whether it’s from an untrained puppy, child, or the unfortunate result of a bad nightmare, pee happens. Here’s how to remove it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it’s a new stain, first blot it up as much as possible with a paper towel.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>To get out the smell or any older stain, mix a couple spoonfuls of laundry detergent with warm water.</li>\n<li>Using an old washcloth or paper towel, apply the mixture to the stain.</li>\n<li>Using a new cloth,  blot the area dry.</li>\n<li>To eliminate the smell, put baking soda over the whole mattress and leave it out to dry for a day. (If you have nowhere else to sleep for the night, remove the baking soda after a few hours.)</li>\n<li>The next day, remove the baking soda using a handheld vacuum or attachment.</li>\n<li>If you can, set your mattress up by an open window to allow air to pass through your mattress for a few more hours.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Blood</h1>\n<p>For women who menstruate and anyone who has shared a bed with them, blood stains on the bed are always a possibility. It’s natural, but it’s also super annoying.</p>\n<p>First, try patting the stain with a cold, wet washcloth and then patting it dry. If that doesn’t remove the blood, and it’s still a fresh stain:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Mix cold water with 2 teaspoons of salt.</li>\n<li>Dip a washcloth into your saltwater solution.</li>\n<li>Blot it onto the stain.</li>\n<li>Blot the area dry so the solution works its way into the stain.</li>\n<li>Dip a new washcloth into cold water and wipe away any remaining solution.</li>\n<li> Blot the area dry.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If it’s an older, set-in bloodstain you just noticed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mix 1 tablespoon of meat tenderizer with 2 teaspoons of cold water to make a paste.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using your finger, rub the paste into the stain.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let sit for 1 hour.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Place a washcloth in cold water and rub off the extra paste.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pat dry with a new washcloth or towel.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Wine</h1>\n<p>Who hasn’t had a nightcap from the comfort of their own bed? After that second glass, your motor skills aren’t as sharp as they were, and you may find yourself with a spill on your hands.</p>\n<p>Dilute, dilute, dilute! For red wine especially, adding water to the affected area as soon as possible weakens the appearance of the stain. If your stain is fresh,</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pour a spoonful of Club Soda on the spill and rub it in.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pour salt on the stain and let it sit as long as possible. The salt absorbs the wet wine.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using a vacuum, remove the salt.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If it’s an older, stubborn spot*,</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put on a pair of gloves</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pour some Hydrogen Peroxide on the affected area</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allow time for dying</li>\n</ol>\n<p>*This method will remove red wine stains, but it could cause slight discoloration of your mattress.</p>\n<h4><strong>Remember: Always make sure to dry the stained area completely to prevent mattress mold and odor.</strong></h4>\n<p>If worst comes to worst and these home remedies do not eliminate the stain to your liking, consider hiring a professional stain removal service. It might be well worth the money if the only other option is to get an entirely new mattress. If your mattress is stained beyond repair, it may be time to consider replacing it.

All of these factors make it more difficult to sleep.

Following these simple steps will help you nod off in no time. In order to improve the quality of your sleep, you have to make your bedroom into a sanctuary. It should be a place of rest and relaxation, free of unnecessary distractions. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Clean up</strong> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Wickwire-Emerson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dr. Emerson Wickwire</a>, assistant professor of psychiatry and medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, says \"physical clutter causes mental clutter, which activates the brain and negatively impacts sleep.\" Even if you're naturally a messy person, you can start by putting that pile of dirty clothes into the hamper. Clearing some of the clutter will help ease your mind. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Choose calming colors</strong></p>\n<p>Your room should make you feel relaxed. Bright wall colors should be avoided in favor of more monochromatic earth tones and calming hues. Bold colors excite the mind and encourage activity, rather than rest, which will keep your brain buzzing instead of sleeping. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Dim the lights </strong></p>\n<p>We all know that light disrupts sleep, so minimize any extra light by using darkening curtains and shades. You should also power down your phone at least a half hour before bed. Blue light emitted from electronic devices disturb sleep, so turn your phone off (or at least put it on night mode). This will cue your brain that it's time for bed. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Keep it cool </strong></p>\n<p>You should keep your bedroom between 60-67 degrees Fahrenheit for optimal sleeping. Your body temperature decreases when you're about to fall asleep, so keeping the thermostat cool will actually facilitate this. The Eight app tracks your body temperature and the temperature of your room so you'll be able to find the idea temperature for dozing off. You can also cool down the bed with technology like that featured in the most advanced bed in the market: the <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/\">Pod</a>. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: Reduce noises</strong></p>\n<p>The key to getting a good night's sleep is to eliminate noises. Although you may not be able to control the honking cars outside your window or the sound of your dishwasher, you can start by keeping your phone on silent. Vibrations and those notification alerts can interrupt sleep.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Step 6: Replace your mattress </strong></p>\n<p>The most important thing is to sleep on something that is comfortable to you. Our mattress was scientifically designed for ultimate comfort. It's got just the right amount of bounce and support to give you your best rest.

I closed my eyes and pictured my new life. I was frolicking through Central Park with Blair Waldorf's clothes and Carrie Bradshaw's attitude, all to the tune of Taylor Swift's \"Welcome To New York.\" Yes, NYC is a true cosmopolitan city (*says with jazz hands). It's lively, trendy, and a city of opportunity. But you know that already. I'm here to talk about the less glamorous part of this place: The apartments. </p>\n<p>Living in NYC is fun and all, but the actually living part can be quite difficult. New York City, specifically Manhattan, is known for being one of the most expensive cities to live in. You'll find a 4th floor walk-up studio the size of your closet with no bathroom door, slanted floors, and no amenities all for the extremely low price of $2,300 a month! What a deal. . .NOT! Because NYC is #thedream, we must accept our overpriced closet and sign the lease (hey, at least there's exposed brick). </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.giphy.com/sFcguEBAEilVK.gif\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"409\" height=\"229\"></p>\n<p>Adjusting to your tiny space is easy compared to the actual moving in part. Carrying a heavy queen-sized mattress up four flights of stairs and through a narrow hallway with tight corners is a feat that deserves a gold medal. I can't tell you how many neighbors I've seen trying to shove their furniture through their door. The look of disappointment on their faces as they realize it won't fit and they have to somehow return it. Skip the exhaustion and frustration by purchasing a mattress in a box! At Eight, our <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/collections/our-products\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">smart mattress</a> is compressed, rolled, and put in a 16\"x16\"x46\" box. That's the size of a golf bag for a reference. Shipping is not only free, but stress-free. Unwrap the mattress and watch as your mattress puffs up in seconds. If only there were couches in a box. . . </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://media2.giphy.com/media/2OP9jbHFlFPW/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"375\" height=\"240\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Big city, big furniture, small box.

You’re a quiet person who needs alone time to recharge. You get overwhelmed easily and love having downtime to sleep away the stress. You’re the type of person who’d rather spend Friday night cooped up in bed watching Netflix than going out to a bar. Your bedroom is super cozy with exposed brick and blue and purple accents while your bed is probably overflowing with fluffy pillows and sherpa blankets.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Starfish</strong></h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><iframe src=\"//giphy.com/embed/9QUhxrq9uRFWU\" width=\"480\" height=\"356.57142857142856\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/simpsons-homer-simpson-snowfall-9QUhxrq9uRFWU\">via GIPHY</a></strong></p>\n<strong> </strong>\n<p>If you tend to sleep on your back with your arms and legs sprawled out, you are most likely an extrovert. You are open, sociable, and confident. You’re a natural-born leader who likes to take charge and dominate the conversation. People are drawn to you because of your charm and charisma. You’re super outgoing and you love to meet new people. Your bedroom is just as bright as you with warm colors like pink, red, yellow, or peach scattered throughout.</p>\n<h3><strong>On Your Side</strong></h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><iframe src=\"//giphy.com/embed/SHEcjjdZz1tWU\" width=\"480\" height=\"251.88118811881188\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/sleeping-SHEcjjdZz1tWU\">via GIPHY</a></strong></p>\n<strong> </strong>\n<p> People who sleep on their sides are open-minded, accepting, and sensitive. You take time to totally open up, but once you do, you’re the life of the party. You’re fun, creative, and energetic. You always have a smile on your face, even when the going gets tough. However, you do tend to overthink things and overreact at times. You have a really chic bedroom with lots of beautiful artwork and perfectly matching colors and pretty patterns. It definitely looks straight out of a catalogue.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Soldier</strong></h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><iframe src=\"//giphy.com/embed/aeu60CPZd8zw4\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/tired-sleeping-peanuts-aeu60CPZd8zw4\">via GIPHY</a></strong></p>\n<p>If you sleep on your back with your arms straight down at your side, you are strong, responsible, and resilient. Like a soldier, you live a very structured lifestyle. You probably go to sleep and wake up at the same time every night. You’re a perfectionist who puts a lot of pressure on yourself to succeed. You definitely prefer a minimalist design in your bedroom and love having an all-white bed spread.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Free Faller</strong></h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><iframe src=\"//giphy.com/embed/uMxlQ4Th8jYHu\" width=\"480\" height=\"250.8\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/tired-sleeping-morning-uMxlQ4Th8jYHu\">via GIPHY</a></strong></p>\n<strong> </strong>\n<p>Freefall sleepers enjoy resting on their stomach. As the name implies, freefall sleepers are free-spirits. You are independent, adventurous, and spontaneous. You love to travel the world and try new things, especially food. Although you tend to be a risk-taker, you’re secretly anxious and crave control. Your bedroom is cool and sophisticated, but also unique. When people walk into it, they just know it belongs to you. Greens, blues, and grays are your favorite colors.</p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Share if this sounds like you!  </span></p>\n<em>We've partnered with our friends at <a href=\"https://www.craneandcanopy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Crane &amp; Canopy</a> to bring you this post. </em>",

Pull back the covers and read on:</p>\r\n<p>There's a reason why every sex scene in a movie ends with the couple falling fast asleep. Sex has been proven to promote better sleep, and it all has to do with the hormones produced during intercourse. Sex boosts oxytocin (a hormone that makes you feel connected to your partner) and lowers cortisol (a stress-related hormone). These changes in hormone levels leave your body feeling naturally more relaxed, resulting in a pleasant transition into sleep.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"//giphy.com/embed/YsSsOGK6tBdTi\" width=\"480\" height=\"391.83673469387753\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/bed-YsSsOGK6tBdTi\">via GIPHY</a></p>\r\n<p>The big snooze especially happens when you reach the Big O. When you have an orgasm, your body releases a cocktail of hormones that help you sleep. Along with sleep-inducing melatonin, o<span>xytocin - aka the love hormone - floods your brain after climax.</span><span> It makes sense that a chemical that contributes to trust </span><span>and intimacy would also encourage drowsiness and calm. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>During an orgasm, the brain also fires feel-good neurotransmitters called endorphins. Low stress levels paired with feelings of intimacy and euphoria have a calming effect on the body, which is the perfect recipe for sleep. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Sex definitely helps you sleep, but it's affect on men and women differs. For women, estrogen levels are known to increase after intercourse, which enhances a woman's REM cycle for a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18710368\" target=\"_blank\">deeper sleep</a>. But don't feel left out, men. After sex, men will release a biochemical known as prolactin, which is directly responsible for feelings of fatigue. No wonder they pass out within minutes! </span></p>\r\n<p>Sex is important for our sleep and vice versa. A good night's rest will do wonders for your sex life. In a study published in <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12858/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Journal of Sexual Medicine</a>, women in romantic relationships reported higher levels of sexual desire and had a 14% increase in the likelihood of sexual activity the next day. Women with longer average sleep duration also reported greater vaginal lubrication during sex than those with shorter average sleep. </p>\r\n<p>Clearly sleep and sex are related. They both are important to our overall health and happiness. Get a little frisky tonight and see your sleep (and mood) improve greatly! </p>",

Here are the top 4 reasons to skip the mattress store and order your mattress online:</p>\n<h2>#1  It saves time</h2>\n<p>Spending a weekend hopping from mattress store to mattress store trying to find the best deal is exhausting and time consuming. Days off are for family, friends, and fun; they’re not for getting aggressively marketed to by a man with a bad mustache in a crowded store. Ordering your mattress online only takes a few minutes. At Eight, we’ll help you do all the shopping without having to leave your bed! You can read reviews, learn about the product, chat with a real person, and order your mattress all in the same place on our <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/collections/our-products\">website</a>.</p>\n<iframe src=\"//giphy.com/embed/kjelbEcB3I33a\" width=\"480\" height=\"271.67785234899327\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/aint-nobody-got-time-for-that-gif-kjelbEcB3I33a\">via GIPHY</a></p>\n<h2>#2 It’s easy</h2>\n<p>From the comfort of your own worn out bed, you can order a new mattress with a few clicks and a credit card. Can’t afford to drop a few hundred all at once? We partnered with Affirm to offer <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/pages/financing\">financing</a>. Affirm is an alternative to loans and credit cards that provides interest-free financing on your purchase of Eight products. You can make easy monthly payments over 3 or 6 months.</p>\n<h2>#3 You don’t have to pay for shipping or returns</h2>\n<p>At Eight, we offer free shipping and returns. Why pay to get it delivered from the store or struggle trying to haul your mattress home when you can get it delivered for free? After 30 days, we’ll refund your purchase if you don’t love it. You have up to 100 nights to send us an email requesting a <a href=\"https://content.eightsleep.com/support/\">refund</a>. We'll send one of our partner companies to remove the mattress, so you don't have to do a thing! </p>\n<h2>#4 You can sleep before you keep</h2>\n<p>Of course, one of the perks of buying from a store is that you can lay on a mattress and see if it’s right for you. But here at Eight, we offer something even better: a 100 night trial. If you’re not sure if our mattress is right for you, try it out for yourself! If you realize it’s not for you, return it free of cost.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ordering a mattress online is the best way to purchase your new mattress. Save yourself time and stress, and order yours online today. </span></p>",

They found that green light produced rapid sleep onset -- between 1 and 3 minutes while blue and violet delayed sleep. When the mice were exposed to violet light, it took them 5-10 minutes to fall asleep. Blue light made them the sleepiest with the onset of sleep taking between 16 and 19 minutes. </p>\r\n<p>The researchers believe this all has to do with a blue light-sensitive pigment called <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952704/\" target=\"_blank\">melanopsin</a>. These light-detecting pigments operate in the retina and seem to affect how we react to different kinds of light. There was also a connection between blue light and corticosterone, a stress hormone produced by the adrenal gland the causes arousal and wakefulness. We could therefore predict that blue light will enhance the wake-promoting effects of light by elevating adrenal stress hormones.</p>\r\n<p>An obvious caveat of this study is that mice are nocturnal, but humans are not. So it very well could mean that green is not the magic color for us. Perhaps green light increases wakefulness rather than sleep. If there's one thing we do know for sure, blue light should be avoided at night. Short-wavelength blue light (emitted from the sun, electronic devices, and fluorescent lighting) shifts the circadian clock, alerts the brain, and suppresses melatonin production. This is why you should avoid looking at your phone before bed. For better sleep, consider powering down your devices at least an hour before bed. Turn it off and you'll rest easy! </p>",

In honor of 4/20 and the U.S. states that have legalized marijuana in some form, we decided to take a look at how weed affects sleep. So throw on some Bob Marley, and let’s get down to basics.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">First, it’s important to understand the two main strands of marijuana: indica and sativa. Indica tends to produce more of a body high while sativa is more rejuvenating. Indica induces body relaxation often followed by sleepiness while sativa tends to make you want to paint a mural dedicated to Doritos while breakdancing to Backstreet Boys. Or so I’ve heard. </span></p>\n<iframe src=\"//giphy.com/embed/7O1juRxdHNguQ\" width=\"480\" height=\"240\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/weed-7O1juRxdHNguQ\">via GIPHY</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In a study conducted by <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https://mic.com/articles/137699/here-s-how-smoking-weed-will-affect-your-sleep#.0yi065ITo\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Mic</a>,</span> most experts concluded that when you smoke indica marijuana before bed, it helps you fall asleep. Indica helps to calm you down so you can fall asleep easily without stress and anxiety keeping you awake.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">But does it help you stay asleep?</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">There are four stages of sleep. According to Dr. Perry Solomon, chief medical officer at <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https://www.hellomd.com/\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\">HelloMD</a></span>, smoking before bed extends the duration of stage three, resulting in a more restful sleep. Yet some experts argue that it’s the fourth stage, REM (rapid eye movement), that matters the most. Marijuana may positively impact your sleep before this stage, but some research suggests it lowers the last stage of sleep.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Becoming dependent on marijuana to help you fall asleep is generally unhealthy. There will inevitably be a time when, for whatever reason, you won’t be able to smoke before bed. If you have been doing it nightly for a long time, falling asleep without it may be near to impossible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Overall, it is important to remember that the science in this field is still limited, so we have to take the findings with a grain of salt (and maybe a bag of Doritos). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><iframe src=\"//giphy.com/embed/xfD6mEBfQM3wk\" width=\"480\" height=\"444.2033898305085\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/deal-with-it-high-sunglasses-xfD6mEBfQM3wk\">via GIPHY</a></p>\nIf you feel you sleep better after smoking and are not dependent on cannabis to sleep, then light it up. But if you find yourself waking up too groggy to function effectively, maybe lay off the bedtime blunt.\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We wish you a good night’s sleep (however you might achieve that), and a happy holiday!</span></p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #000000;\">*Eight does not endorse the sale or use of marijuana in states where it is not legalized. </span></h5>",

Similarly, if you wake up with aches and pains, then it’s often a sign you need to replace your mattress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your mattress helps determine whether or not you are well rested. So knowing when to replace it will ensure your mattress doesn’t bully you into bad sleep. Ultimately, it’s a personal decision. If you find your mattress is negatively affecting you before the recommended average lifespan is over, then replace it.

If you’re not sure when it’s time for a replacement, read more <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/when-to-replace-your-mattress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. After 7-10 years, mattresses can get worn out and lose their original comfort and support. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When getting rid of your old mattress, the first thing to consider is what shape your mattress is in. </span></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>If it still has some life in it:</b></h4>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Sell</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s no shame in wanting some money back from your old mattress to help finance your new one. Listing your old mattress on sites like Craigslist, OfferUp, or eBay allows you to connect with potential buyers. Alternatively, you can try selling your mattress to a local consignment store.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>OR</b></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Donate</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Places like Habitat for Humanity and Goodwill allow you to drop off your mattress at many locations. At other charities, you can even schedule a pickup. Many homeless shelters and churches accept mattress donations as well. This is a great option that makes you feel good about giving back to your community. You could also donate your old mattress to friends or family who are looking for a mattress for a spare room. </span></p>\n<em><em><br></em></em>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>If it’s so worn out that it’s not even fit for your mean mother- in-law to sleep on: </b></h4>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Hire someone to take it off your hands</b></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not everyone has a big enough vehicle, strong enough muscles, or enough time to dispose of their old mattress themselves. Luckily, you can pay someone to dispose of it for you. There are many junk removal sites out there like 1-800-GOT-JUNK that provide removal services. Another alternative would be paying someone in your neighborhood to take it to a safe recycling center for you. Post signs near your street to get in contact with people, or simply ask capable neighbors.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>OR</b></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Recycle it</b></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Help to keep the Earth green by not dumping your old mattress on the sidewalk.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> According to environmentalists, <a href=\"http://ecovisionslc.org/mattresses-and-landfills-the-great-green-dilemma/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">14-20 million mattresses</a> (450 pounds) wind up in the landfill each year, consuming about 23 cubic feet of landfill space. These numbers are sad considering mattresses are 85-90% recyclable. Most of the materials that make up a mattress - metal coils, wood, cotton, food - can be recycled and repurposed into everyday items. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>OR</b></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Take it apart </b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an option best for innerspring mattresses. You can use the parts from innerspring mattresses in a number of ways.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>-Scrap it </b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steel springs can be sold as scrap. Who couldn’t use some extra cash?</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>-Craft it </b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use the wooden parts or springs for those Pinterest projects you’ve been dying to make.

Personally, “To watch the next episode or to sleep?” is a potential title for my autobiography. Of course, we </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> be getting eight hours, but who can resist the wit of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parks and Rec</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s Leslie? (K)nope, not me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sad truth is, those late Netflix nights negatively impact our sleep which can in turn negatively impact our days. Recently, it was revealed that Netflix users watched half a billion hours of Adam Sandler movies.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As </span><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/leticiamiranda/people-watched-500-million-hours-of-adam-sandler-on-netflix?utm_term=.oq2B0O2nM1#.nokBD6y1JY%20\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buzzfeed </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">puts it, “that’s the equivalent of almost 63 million nights where instead of sleeping, people stayed up all night watching Adam Sandler movies.”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we have those late night Sandler movie marathons, we miss out on valuable sleep. Without the proper amount of sleep, our cognitive functions are impaired the next day. When you are not well rested, you cannot work to your full potential. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only does watching television late at night make us miss out on sleep, but it can make it harder to fall asleep in the first place. According to </span><a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bright-screens-could-delay-bedtime/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scientific American</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, luminous screens on tablets, phones, and laptops can “...s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uppress people's normal nighttime release of melatonin.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  Melatonin is a hormone that tells your body when it’s time to sleep.

But for those of us who need those nightly Netflix binges, there are options to help minimize the effects.  Try switching to blue light; there is a nighttime function on some devices that you can turn on to make the luminous light softer. There are also functions on some devices that switch at nighttime so when you’re reading you see white text on a black screen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re in an unhealthy relationship with Netflix, but in order to maintain a healthy relationship with sleep, we need to make some changes. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Billy Madison </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can wait until the next morning.</span></p>\n<iframe src=\"//giphy.com/embed/EH40EOCxyQGis\" width=\"480\" height=\"217.92000000000002\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/man-humor-EH40EOCxyQGis\">via GIPHY</a></p>",

            "body_html": "<p>How many hours of sleep do I actually need a night?</p>\n<p>It’s a question people have been wondering forever. The truth is, it depends. There is no one amount that is ideal for everyone per night. People are different, so it makes sense that the amount of sleep each person needs at night will vary. However, most scientists agree that you should get no less than eight hours total. So if you miss an hour or so at night, this must be made up in the form of naps.</p>\n<p>If you can get seven hours of sleep a night and have the luxury of an afternoon nap, then go for it. But if you know you will be unable to nap, aim for the full eight hours at night.</p>\n<p>Sleeping may feel like a waste of time, but if you don’t get the right amount of sleep, your time spent awake will be a waste too. You will have less energy to do what you love when awake, and chances are you’ll be too grumpy to enjoy being awake anyways. According to <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/how-many-hours-sleep-do-you-actually-need?src=SOC&amp;dom=fb&amp;con=Quartz#page-3\">Popsci</a>, your cognitive performance suffers when you have a lack of sleep.  Many people think they can function on seven hours of sleep or less. Popsci explains that the problem is most people don’t <i>realize </i>they’re sleep deprived. If you missed a few hours of sleep last night, you may not realize how it is impairing your work today.</p>\n<p>The reason many people claim they do not get the recommended eight hours a night is that they are too busy and don’t have time. To this, Matthew Walker, the director of the sleep and neuroimaging lab at the University of California, Berkeley, says, “The reason you are left with so much to do could likely be because you are only getting five hours of sleep and your cognitive functioning is deficient, so it's taking you forever to do everything.\"</p>\n<p>So are you wasting your life by sleeping? Sort of, but your life will be wasted even more if you don’t get the recommended eight hours. Your cognitive functioning will be impaired, and you will end up wasting the time you are awake since you won’t be fully alert.</p>\n<p>It’s 2017. Take one glance at the news, and you’ll realize now more than ever it is important to be fully functioning and alert when awake. You need to know what’s going on and be able to appropriately react. This can only happen if you get your eight hours. Take it from us at <a href=\"https://eightsleep.com/\">Eight</a> -- we believe in the importance of eight hours so much we made it our name.</p>",

We give you a sleep score so you can change your sleeping patterns if needed and wake up ready to take on the day.</p>\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n<p>The technology in the Eight Smart Mattress and the Eight Sleep Tracker tracks your sleep phases during the night using built in piezo sensors. These sensors detect your heart and respiratory rate. The technology can also detect body movement.</p>\n<p>The information picked up by the technology in the bed is transferred to the Hub which processes the data. This data then shows up on the Eight app and your sleep score is calculated based on this information.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://content.eightsleep.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/9.2.MissingWeekData.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-12038 alignright\" src=\"https://content.eightsleep.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/9.2.MissingWeekData.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"334\" height=\"307\"></a></h3>\n<h3>What is it?</h3>\n<p>The Sleep Score is a measure of overall sleep performance. Your sleep score is out of 100. Each morning, you will get a sleep score from the night before. You can view you sleep score daily, weekly, and monthly.</p>\n<p>Your Sleep Score is calculated by using a proprietary algorithm that combines a number of factors about your sleep.</p>\n<p>Think of your sleep score as a sort of nightly test, but try not to let the colors give you nightmares of those grade school math tests. You can always improve your sleep score.</p>\n<p>The color indicates the level of your Sleep Score. On average, certain sleep factors will produce a certain sleep score.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Red</span></strong> = OK, but your sleep needs improvement</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Score range: 50 – 66</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avg time slept: 4hrs 30min</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avg toss &amp; turns: 52 times</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #ffff00;\">Yellow</span></strong> = Good, but still room for improvement</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Score range: 67 – 83</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avg time slept: 5hrs 30min</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avg toss &amp; turns: 23 times</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #6aa84f;\">Green</span></strong> = A+, you’re well rested</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Score range: 84 – 100</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avg time slept: 8hrs</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avg toss &amp; turns: 7 times</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When your score is in the red zone, it is natural to want to improve your sleep score. But don’t obsess over it; save that for the next season of Game of Thrones. Look at your sleep score as a benchmark on your sleep. You can use it as a kind of thermometer to know what changes you can make to get your best rest.</p>\n<p> </p>",

We may think about the work that needs to get done the next day, or we may reflect more intimately on our lives and wonder if our second grade crush Robbie was actually “the one.”  However, we tend not to think about the naturally occurring processes that can affect our sleep quality at night.</p>\n<h2>What is Thermoregulation?</h2>\n<p>Thermoregulation is a natural process that makes sure our bodies stay at a healthy core internal temperature. According to<a href=\"http://www.healthline.com/health/thermoregulation#overview1\"> Healthline</a>, this normal core temperature is between 98°F (37°C) and 100°F (37.8°C). If your body goes above or below these temperatures, there can be extreme health risks. Luckily, through thermoregulation your body will try to bring you back to a healthy internal temperature.</p>\n<h2>So what does this have to do with sleep?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tuck.com/thermoregulation/\">Tuck.com</a> states that body and brain temperature fall during <a href=\"http://www.howsleepworks.com/types_nonrem.html\">NREM</a> (non-rapid eye movement) sleep. During REM sleep, the brain temperature increases.</p>\n<p>When core body temperature drops, that’s when sleep usually occurs. Maintaining the right skin temperature is important for a sound sleep. When <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18192289\">skin temperature</a> is slightly raised, it does not affect core body temperature and has been shown to improve sleep quality.</p>\n<p>Your bedroom temperature can affect thermoregulation. A bedroom that is too cool or too hot can mess up your sleep and prevent you from reaching deep sleep. Deep sleep is needed to feel well rested, but body thermoregulation is more effective in light sleep.<a href=\"https://content.eightsleep.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-09-21-at-4.24.08-PM.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-12585 alignright\" src=\"https://content.eightsleep.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-09-21-at-4.24.08-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"392\" height=\"206\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></a></p>\n<p>If you’re finding that you’re not well rested, it may be that your bedroom temperature has affected normal processes in your body. On the Eight app, you can see the temperature of your room and bed and make adjustments as needed. For some people, warming up before bed can improve sleep. With Eight’s warming feature, you can set the warmth individually on each side of the bed to get a better sleep.</p>\n<p>Learn more about Eight’s warming feature in the Smart Mattress <a href=\"https://content.eightsleep.com/faqs/warming/\">here.</a></p>",

            "body_html": "<p class=\"p1\">With so many mattresses out there, how do you know if Eight Smart Mattress is the one for you? Well, we've made it easy for you by giving you an in-depth and honest comparison so you can make a smart decision regarding your sleep! Today we're comparing Eight and Casper. </p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Let's Compare</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/EightvsCasper_076303b7-34a9-4d40-851d-b0463409a6ba_1024x1024.png?v=1492713025\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3><b>Eight</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Eight Smart Mattress is a one of a kind mattress that combines ultimate comfort with sleep technology. Eight’s four layers of premium high-density foam provide unparalleled support. The foam is specially designed to offer bounce and comfort while ensuring a cool temperature. What really sets Eight apart from its competitors is the technology. The mattress comes with a smart cover and sleep tracker that measures your sleep and gives you insight on your sleeping habits. By learning about your sleep patterns, you will improve your sleep and wake up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day! In addition, Eight is the only mattress that has a bed warming feature, a smart alarm, and full smart home integration - all controlled and customized from the tip of your finger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Eight mattress falls at a 6 out of 10 on the firmness scale, which means it’s not too firm and not too soft. It offers dynamic support and contouring comfort without sacrificing breathability or resilience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/FirmScale_large.png?v=1492635040\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></span></p>\n<h3>\n<b>Casper</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>\n</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Casper mattress consists of four layers of foam and falls at a 7 out of 10 on the firmness scale. Although it’s slightly firmer than the Eight mattress, the foams are fairly soft which create more sinkage, especially in heavier sleepers. Because the material is so soft, Casper has very minimal edge support. If you like to sleep on the edge of the bed, you may feel like you’re going to roll off the bed. Furthermore, the mattress tends to produce a mild smell upon unboxing, and users have said it takes a few hours to days to completely dissipate.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><b>Eight has 4 layers of foam and 1 layer of tech</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight is the only mattress in the market that has smart features. Micro-heating elements embedded in the cover heat things up with a simple tap on the app. The bed warming feature allows you to heat up each side of the bed individually so couples can customize their sleep temperatures. You can turn warming on and off automatically each night by setting your personal schedule. Scientists say sleeping in a cool room is beneficial for your health. With the Eight Smart Mattress, you can set your thermostat low but stay warm and cozy in bed. In addition to the warming feature, Eight also has a smart alarm that wakes you up at your lightest level of sleep and total smart home integration - all controlled and customized from the tip of your finger.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/indvidually_grande.jpg?v=1492701109\" style=\"float: none;\"></p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>How does Eight compare to the rest?</strong> </span></strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/ReviewsALL_grande.png?v=1492637668\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; float: none;\"></span></strong></p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What do the experts say?</strong> </span></strong></h3>\n<p><em><strong>They love it! </strong></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sleepopolis.com/mattress-reviews/eight-sleep-mattress-review/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>﻿</em>﻿Sleepopolis</a> recommends this mattress for sleepers who want to improve the quality of their sleep and achieve a great night's sleep.
