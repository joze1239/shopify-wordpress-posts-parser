The Real Reason Why You're Waking Up Tired,170553731,"<p>Ugh, is it morning already??? </p>
<p>If you're the type of person who wakes up feeling groggy and exhausted, there is an explanation. Actually, there are several reasons why you might feel so tired, even after getting a solid amount of sleep. </p>
<p><strong>1. Your bedroom is too dark </strong></p>
<p>You may love sleeping in utter darkness, but your beloved blackout curtains could be the culprit of your tiredness. If no daylight can seep through your windows, your internal clock won't know day from night. Exposure to sunshine in the morning will signal your brain that it's time to wake up and help you feel more refreshed. </p>
<p><strong>2. Late-night technology </strong></p>
<p>We know it's hard to disconnect from the world, but all that harsh blue light from your TV, laptop, and phone stimulates the brain and makes it difficult to settle down before bed. Try to shut off your technology about an hour before going to sleep. If you really can't do that, at least power down your phone. You can save your Instagram scrolling for the next day. </p>
<p><strong>3. Too many distractions</strong></p>
<p>If you live in a busy city, it may be difficult to tune out the honking cars and barking dogs at night. Being woken up in the middle of the night will cause you to feel extra tired the next day. In order to eliminate some of those distractions, invest in a white noise machine or keep a fan on low to down out any of the sounds that may wake you. Outdoor noises can only be silenced so much, but you do have total control over what's inside your house. Make sure to fix that running toilet of yours and put your phone on silent, as a 2 AM text notification could definitely interrupt your slumber. </p>
<p><strong>4. All that coffee </strong></p>
<p>It is recommended to stop drinking caffeinated beverages by mid-afternoon or earlier. Caffeine interrupts the flow of melatonin - the chemical that sends us to sleep, and drinking a bunch of coffee during the day will negatively effect your sleep patterns. Besides keeping you awake, caffeine can also cause heartburn, which can make sleep awfully uncomfortable. </p>
<p><strong>5. The food you ate </strong></p>
<p>A healthy lifestyle leads to healthier sleep, specifically your diet. Foods high in sugar, fat, and processed carbs have been associated with daytime sleepiness. You should also avoid foods that cause indigestion, acid reflux, or heartburn such as spicy foods, tomato sauce, or citrus fruits. Heartburn is exacerbated when you lie down as it allows the acid to creep up into the esophagus and burn the sensitive lining. </p>
<p><strong>6. You are actually not a morning person </strong></p>
<p>According to science, there are morning people and night people, and it has to do with your circadian system. The circadian system is a region of 20,000 nerve cells that keeps your body on schedule throughout the day, regulating everything from hormone levels to when you feel tired. Some people are ""phase advanced,"" meaning they feel tired early in the evening. Others are ""phase delayed,"" meaning you don't feel tired until late at night. Even though not being a morning person is your biology, you can hack the system. Sticking to a regimented sleep schedule and avoiding light before bed will help you feel tired earlier and make mornings easier. </p>
<p>To sum it all up, a good night's sleep isn't just about the amount of shuteye you get. You need to sleep in a quality environment conducive for sleep. This means parting the blinds up for some sunlight, turning off your devices, limiting your caffeine intake, and eating well. Another way to get your best rest?

What Do Your Dreams Really Mean?,170500035,"<p>For the longest time, we have accepted the Freudian perspective on dreams - that dreams are highly symbolic representations of unconscious desire. Today, however, most brain scientists are rejecting that idea. </p>
<p>There are many theories as to why people dream, and despite the scientific progress in recent years, it still remains a big mystery. What we do know is that dreams seem to replay everyday life. Many researchers believe dreams have a close relationship to the way our brains process memories. Dreaming may be a way for the brain to ""take new information, combine it with old information in these totally strange ways, and see if it can get any insights in the usefulness of that information, says <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/06/22/533834764/forget-freud-dreams-replay-everyday-life"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Robert Stickgold</a>, a sleep researcher at Harvard Medical School. </p>
<p>Dreams occur during REM sleep, and so does a process called memory consolidation. During REM sleep, the brain relives recent experiences and stores them into long-term memory. Some scientists believe dreaming is an essential part of this memory processing while others think it's just a byproduct of the brain's nighttime activity. </p>
<p>Another theory calls dreams an extension of waking consciousness, meaning dreams reflect the experience of real life. At sleep onset, students preparing for exams commonly re-experience the material they were studying during the day, lovers have fantasies about their romantic partner, and software developers often see bits of code unfolding in their mind's eye. </p>
<p>Although Freud's theory has little scientific proof, some of his observations are still relevant. For instance, he talked about common dream symbols - such as having one's teeth fall out. He went on to explain this as a symbol for castration. Maybe that's true, maybe it's not. But it is interesting that tons of people have this type of dream. Perhaps we share many dreams because we share the same nervous system design, and many of the same anxieties. </p>
<p>Dreams are such an enigma because they deal with consciousness, a concept that has baffled scientists and philosophers for centuries. When you dream, you are in an altered state of consciousness. It's not the same as wakeful consciousness, but you are experiencing something that appears completely real. Lucid dreaming - when the dreamer is aware of dreaming - opens intriguing possibilities for the study of consciousness. Some researchers say lucid dreaming is a state in which the brain is simultaneously awake and dreaming. Therefore, it may be possible to have dreamers ask themselves in the moment what their dreams mean. WHOA. </p>
<p>Clearly, there is still a lot of research needed to understand dreams. But for now, we're just going to take a night to sleep on all this information...</p>

Here's Why You Can't Fall Asleep In A New Place,170498499,"<p>Vacations are meant for rest and relaxation, so why is that we often struggle to sleep on our hotel's heavenly bed? </p>
<p>Well, it turns out that your brain is the blame. It appears that half of your brain may remain alert when you sleep in a new location, especially on the first night away from home. Scientists call this phenomenon the ""First Night Effect,"" and they've known about it for <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1966.tb02650.x/abstract"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">over 50 years</a>. </p>
<p>In order to better understand this effect, scientists from <a href=""https://news.brown.edu/articles/2016/04/sleep"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Brown University</a> devised an interesting experiment. They hooked people up to brain-monitoring equipment and played quiet beeping noises by each ear of the sleeper. Researchers found that on the first night of the experiment, the left side of the brain reacted strongly to the sound, compared with the right side. It wasn't the entire left hemisphere affected, but only the default mode network - a group of brain regions associated with spontaneous unfocused mental activity, like daydreaming. Noises played on the left side more frequently woke people up, as well. However, on the second night of the experiment, both brain hemispheres responded at the same level, and the beeps woke fewer people up. </p>
<p>This suggests that humans may be a bit like birds when they sleep. Birds sleep with one eye open and half of their brain awake so that they can stay alert and make important fight or flight decisions. Although we don't sleep with one eye open, something about an unfamiliar environment is keeping our left side of the brain awake. We subconsciously want to stay awake due to the increased anxiety we have around sleeping away from home. It is an adaptive and animalistic response that provides us with protection when sleeping in novel environments. </p>
<p>In order to reduce the first night effect, make your hotel room feel more like your bedroom. Bringing your own pillow and doing the same nighttime routine may trick your brain into thinking you are at home. Staying in a familiar hotel brand will also help ease your mind and make you sleep more comfortable. </p>",,7/3/2017 11:33,heres-why-you-cant-fall-asleep-in-a-new-place,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-638933294.jpg?v=1499096388,,open,open,Uncategorized,"Culture, Lifestyle"
The Best Cure For Your Hangover,170463491,"<p>Whether it's pickle juice, bananas, Pedialyte, or a greasy burger, we all have our preferred hangover remedies. While there's no sure-fire ""cure"" for a hangover, there are methods that work better than others in alleviating that brutal headache. </p>
<p>Hangovers usually involve a gnarly headache, nausea, irritability, and tiredness. The main cause of your hangover symptoms is dehydration, which is why it is important to drink plenty of water - before, during, and after a night of drinking. However, many of us forget to drink water when we go out. With a boozy drink already in hand, it's hard to think of hydrating with something other than a gin and tonic. </p>
<p>With water out of the question, the next best cure - and the one that works every time, is sleep. Alcohol significantly disrupts sleep. It reduces REM sleep, wakes you up before you're truly rested, and aggravates breathing problems. This is why you often feel tired after a night of heavy drinking. The only way to get rid of that feeling is to catch up on the sleep you missed the night before. If you can manage to nod off for an hour or two, you might just feel better. </p>
<p>Sleeping can also help prevent a hangover. Getting enough sleep will improve your immunity and get your body ready to handle a night of drinking. When the body is well-equipped, it can better process alcohol. </p>
<p>When it comes to hangovers, the phrase ""sleeping it off,"" has never been truer. Get a good night's sleep, and you'll feel good in the morning! </p>

This Simple Test Will Tell You If Your Mattress Is Too Old,170462019,"<p>Have you checked your mattress lately? If not, maybe now is a good time to do so. Mattresses -- just like sneakers, tires, or anything else we use -- are affected by wear and tear. And an old mattress can be detrimental to your sleep. If you find yourself waking up stiff or tired in the morning, your mattress may be to blame. </p>
<p>Consumer Reports Magazine recommends replacing your mattress every 7 to 10 years. Because every mattress is different, it's important to feel for yourself if you really need a new one. Generally, a mattress with a noticeable sag in the middle means it's time for an upgrade. This means that your old mattress has lost foundation and support, which can lead to back pain and disrupted sleep. </p>
<p><strong>You can do a simple test at home to see if it's time for your mattress to go:</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">The body impression ruler measures the amount of sag in your mattress. If the impression is in the <span style=""color: #000000;"">yellow zone</span>, it's definitely time to start looking for a new mattress.

"The Easiest Ways To Wake Up Happy Every Morning, According To A Laughter Therapist",170441091,"<p>Laughter truly is the best medicine. It releases all the feel-good chemicals, relieves stress, and stimulates the organs.</p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p>A simple burst of laughter can decrease depression and anxiety, lower blood pressure, manage pain, enhance creativity and productivity, burn calories, and more. Unfortunately, most adults have little laughter in their lives. Children laugh about 150 times a day while adults only laugh about 12 times per day. If we just laughed a little more, we could be so much happier. And lifelong happiness begins in the morning. Waking up on the right side of the bed can do wonders for your mood. </p>
<p>In an interview with <a href=""http://www.byrdie.com/how-to-become-happy/slide9"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">BYRDIE</a>, laughter coach Francine Shore shared nine tips for waking up and feeling great. </p>
<p><strong>1. Start your morning with gratitude </strong></p>
<p>The first thing you should do every morning is write down three things you're grateful for. Even if yesterday was horrible, there are always positive things to be grateful for. The practice of physically writing down these positives is restorative. It allows you to approach the day from a place of contentment, not bitterness. </p>
<p><img src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/CbH03dCwjTUzK/giphy.gif"" alt="""" width=""277"" height=""136""></p>
<p><strong>2. Smile</strong></p>
<p>This is the simplest thing to do. One smile can trick your mind into feeling happier. When you smile, your body releases endorphins and serotonin, which make you feel good. </p>
<p><img src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/B0vFTrb0ZGDf2/giphy.gif"" alt="""" width=""279"" height=""147""></p>
<p><strong>3. Take a deep breath</strong></p>
<p>Another easy thing to do. Taking a few minutes to breath deeply each morning have significant mood-boosting effects. Deep breathing promotes feelings of calm and relieves stress. </p>
<p><img src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/GJycRLp6zYGFq/giphy.gif"" alt="""" width=""278"" height=""137""></p>
<p><strong>4. Go outside</strong></p>
<p>The happiest people are those who spend time in sunshine and nature. Nature has the ability to heal and awaken the senses. According to Shore, nature reminds us that there is ""something larger out there in the universe,"" and this helps us reign in our egos. She also notes that taking a moment to notice the beauty that surrounds us helps us remember that ""there truly is good in the world."" Even if you don't live near a beach or mountains, you can still benefit by taking a stroll through the park or walking to work instead of riding the subway. </p>
<p> <img src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/TnDoEoXfT7YoE/giphy-downsized-large.gif"" alt="""" width=""272"" height=""153""></p>
<p><strong>5. Just dance</strong></p>
<p>Music and dance actually make you happier. Dancing to good music connects with the emotional centers in the brain. It releases endorphins and reduces levels of cortisol - the stress hormone. Because we spend so much time cooped up in an office in front of a screen, we don't get much time to run around and be free. Dancing and singing makes you feel good because it makes you feel alive. </p>
<p><img src=""https://media4.giphy.com/media/iPTTjEt19igne/giphy.gif"" alt="""" width=""286"" height=""161""></p>
<p><strong>6. Wear bright colors</strong></p>
<p>Wearing a pop of color will immediately brighten your mood and it has the ability to enhance someone else's mood when they're with you. If you're feeling sad, wear yellow. Yellow is considered the brightest and most cheerful of all the colors. If you're feeling anxious, choose something more soothing like lavender or light blue. </p>
<p><img src=""https://media1.giphy.com/media/10NU78sKOSQXcI/giphy.gif"" alt="""" width=""287"" height=""157""></p>
<p><strong>7. Volunteer</strong></p>
<p>""Volunteering helps us develop a deeper sense of compassion and creates a sense of joy and community, Shore says. It helps you get out of your own head and do something for the greater good. You don't have to be a full blown activist for this to work. Spend a morning walking dogs at a local animal shelter. That'll cheer you right up! </p>
<p><img src=""https://media0.giphy.com/media/l4hLQsWNKcQmFCWmA/giphy.gif"" alt="""" width=""289"" height=""163""></p>
<p><strong>8. Play with a puppy </strong></p>
<p>Speaking of dogs, our blood pressure physically lowers when we pet and play with animals. Cats and dogs give unconditional love, which makes us feel more connected and secure. This then promotes feelings of calmness and happiness. If you aren't lucky enough to have a furry pet of your own, ask someone to pet their dog in the morning. We're sure they won't mind! </p>
<p><img src=""https://media4.giphy.com/media/l0ExvA6hnrdzQ5zoI/giphy.gif"" alt="""" width=""290"" height=""163""></p>
<p><strong>9. Watch something funny</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the day, it's important to do anything that'll keep you laughing. Put on an episode of <em>Parks and Recreation</em> before bed or watch a funny movie on Netflix. ""Find the funny in the most ordinary of places,"" says Shore. ""Choose levity in your life. It's a positive coping mechanism.""</p>
<p><img src=""https://media3.giphy.com/media/xUPGclJ5wKOJmENxcs/giphy.gif"" alt="""" width=""308"" height=""173""></p>

This Is The Exact Amount Of Sleep You Need To Be Happy,170439811,"<p>We all know that getting enough sleep is vital for our health, but how much is enough? </p>
<p>According to a <a href=""https://www.amerisleep.com/blog/counting-sheep-losing-sleep/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">new study</a>, the amount of sleep you should aim for is seven hours six minutes. The researchers surveyed over 2,000 participants to find the exact time - down to the very minute - it takes for sleep to most effectively boost your happiness. </p>
<p>Participants who slept <strong>seven hours and six minutes</strong> rated themselves as ""perfectly happy."" People who slept seven hours rated themselves as ""mostly happy,"" and those who slept for six hours and 54 minutes reported themselves as ""somewhat happy."" Apparently those who got less than six hours 48 minutes of sleep marked themselves as having unhappiness within their relationships as well as anxiety. </p>
<p>It seems as though the mood benefits of sleep boils down to a number game. Sleeping just a couple minutes less can make a notable difference in emotional well-being. </p>
<p>Sleep experts recommend a minimum of seven hours of sleep, but maybe now it's okay to hit the snooze button a few times in order to get those extra six minutes. </p>
<p>It's important to note that quality of sleep is equally as important as the quantity of sleep. The same survey showed that ""participants who meditate or take a shower before getting into bed got the best sleep."" On the other hand, those who did work or played video games before bed got worse sleep. Relaxing before bed helps you achieve a restful sleep. The Eight Sleep Tracker measures whether you've had a restful sleep or not by telling you how many times you tossed and turned and how many times you woke up in the night. The less your sleep is disturbed, the higher the quality. </p>
<p>Getting sufficient sleep is vital for your health and happiness. It repairs your body, organizes your mind, boosts your energy levels, and regulates your mood. So let's start prioritizing good sleep, you'll thank us later. 😊</p>",,6/29/2017 11:06,this-is-the-exact-amount-of-sleep-you-need-to-be-happy,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-695505678.jpg?v=1498749188,,open,open,Uncategorized,"Lifestyle, Trending"
How An Adjustable Pillow Can Help You Sleep Better,170423299,"<p>Tired of waking up with a sore neck or back pain? Well, your pillow could be the underlying problem. <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pillows impact the quality of our sleep, and the wrong pillow can keep us from getting a good night’s rest. You need a pillow that will keep your neck and spine aligned in a neutral position while sleeping. Because everyone is different, not every pillow is perfect for everyone. </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">The key is to find a pillow that is the right height and firmness for the person's size, sleeping position, and personal preferences, which is why we developed the <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/pages/ultimatepillow"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Ultimate Pillow</a>.</p>
<p class=""p1""><img src=""//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/Screen_Shot_2017-07-11_at_10.03.37_AM_grande.png?v=1499793048"" alt="""" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Ultimate Pillow is an adjustable pillow that fits to your individual needs. It </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is stuffed with three individual layers so you can customize the height and firmness of your pillow for ultimate comfort depending on how you sleep</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Read below for tips on finding the proper alignment and how you can adjust your Eight Ultimate Pillow to achieve it.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Back Sleepers</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When lying on your back, a pillow should support the natural curvature of your neck. You want a pillow that’s a little firmer so the head doesn’t go back too far. The pillow should also have contouring properties so it can take on the shape of your head. A medium-firm memory foam pillow offers the best support for back sleepers because it contours to the head while also providing structure and stability between the neck and spine. You can use the insertable cushions to add extra loft in the bottom third of the pillow to cradle your neck. The height of the pillow should be neither too high so that it tilts the head too far forward, nor too low that it extends the neck and tilts the head upwards. Generally, the pillow should be around 3 to 6 inches thick to provide adequate support.  </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><img src=""//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/1pillow_illustrations_back_grande.jpg?v=1498848458"" alt=""""></span></p>
<p><b>Side Sleepers</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unlike back and stomach sleepers, side sleepers require extra support. Because of the greater distance between their heads and the mattress, side sleepers typically need thicker and firmer pillows to keep their head and neck in a neutral position. Make sure your pillow is the right thickness between your ear and your mattress so that the neck is evenly aligned with the spine. The best pillow for side sleepers is one that will stay firm all through the night. The memory foam layer in the Ultimate Pillow will do just that, while maintaining the pillow’s shape and stabilizing the neck, as well.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><img src=""//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/1pillow_illustrations_side_grande.jpg?v=1498848472"" alt=""""></span></p>
<p><b>Stomach Sleepers</b></p>
<p>If possible, avoid sleeping on your stomach as it’s difficult to maintain the proper spinal position. When lying on your belly, your back is compressed and your neck is usually twisted, which causes discomfort. However, if you are absolutely adamant about sleeping on your stomach, opt for a softer and lower pillow that will cradle the head. You want to have less fill in your pillow than those who sleep on their side or back. If you sleep on your stomach with a pillow that’s too thick, your spine will bend at an angle which is more likely to cause aches and pains.</p>
<p><b>Firmness</b></p>
<p><b><img src=""//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/4_grande.jpg?v=1499351897"" alt="""" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""></b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A pillow that is too firm will not allow your neck to fully relax while asleep. However, a pillow that is too soft may not offer enough support. This is where our Ultimate Pillow comes in handy. You can adjust the firmness by rearranging the layers and adding or removing the cushions until your neck feels properly supported. For a firmer pillow, sleep with the memory foam piece on top. For the softest, remove the  memory foam and just sleep on the cushions.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""></span></p>
<p><b>How To Test Your Pillow</b></p>
<p>Wondering how to find if your pillow is right for you? Here’s a quick test you can do.</p>
<p>1. Stand next to a wall as if you were lying down on your mattress. For example, a back sleeper should stand with their back against the wall and side sleeper should stand with their side against the wall.</p>
<p><img src=""//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/1_grande.jpg?v=1499710828"" alt="""" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""></p>
<p>2. Rest your head against the wall. Notice how your neck and head probably isn’t straight with your spine. It’s the job of your pillow to fill this gap.</p>
<p><img src=""//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/2_1_grande.jpg?v=1499710961"" alt=""""></p>
<p>3. Put the pillow in between your head and the wall. If your spine is straight from your neck to back, you’ve found the right pillow for your body.</p>
<p><img src=""//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/3_grande.jpg?v=1499711083"" alt=""""></p>

8 Things We Learned From SLEEP 2017 Conference,170408067,"<p>In the beginning of June, thousands of researchers gathered in Boston to present new research and discuss the latest developments in clinical sleep medicine and sleep science. Here are some highlights from the <a href=""http://www.sleepmeeting.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">SLEEP 2017 CONFERENCE</a>. </p>
<p><strong>1. Regular sleep is linked to happiness</strong></p>
<p>Researchers from MIT measured the sleep habits of college students for one month. They calculated something called a sleep regularity index, which was the likelihood of being awake or asleep across all time-points during the day. Results showed that higher regular sleep schedules are significantly associated with higher morning and evening happiness, healthiness, and calmness. </p>
<p><strong>2. Sleep loss makes us prone to risky behavior</strong></p>
<p>According to psychologists from Iowa State University, we're most prone to taking risks when we're moderately tired rather than full-on sleep-deprived. Why? Sleep loss makes us prone to risky behavior because it impairs mental processes involved in self-control. However, when we're super exhausted, we lack the ability and energy to follow through on impulses. A slightly tired person, on the other hand, has less self-control and enough energy to take risks.</p>
<p><strong>3. Positive thinking helps you sleep </strong></p>
<p>Rumination, the act of repeatedly obsessing over negative thoughts, can get in the way of sleep. On the contrary, positive types of repetitive thought - called savoring - can actually promote sleep. Researchers at the University of Alabama, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Virginia Commonwealth, and South Texas Veterans Health Care System studied the relationship between sleep, rumination, and savoring. Rumination was associated with poor health and disturbed sleep while savoring predicted lower levels of disturbed sleep.</p>
<p><strong>4. Successful people aren't sending late-night tweets</strong></p>
<p>Sorry Donald Trump, but successful people aren't spending the wee hours of the night tweeting. According to preliminary data from sociologists at Stony Brook University, late night behavior on Twitter can be used as a proxy for not sleeping. The researchers studied game stats and twitter account activity for 112 NBA players. They found that NBA players scored fewer points and took fewer shots when they'd send tweets the night before a game. </p>
<p><strong>5. To remember more, run around <em>and</em> rest up</strong></p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Montreal and the University of Glasgow sought to see if exercise and sleep, combined, affect memory more than either of them do alone. For the study, young adults completed a memory task after doing one of three activities: moderate exercise, hour-long naps, or both. They found that the group who did the exercise-nap combo scored the highest on the memory task. </p>
<p><strong>6. Quality over quantity for better sleep</strong></p>
<p>Derk Dijk, a researcher of sleep and circadian rhythms, studied what makes a person more likely to report better sleep. He found that low number of awakenings and high amount of REM both predicted a subjective report of feeling refreshed. Total sleep time was not a significant factor. </p>
<p><strong>7. Insomniacs have the realest dreams</strong></p>
<p>Psychologists at Laval University in Quebec tested their hypothesis that insomniacs continue to process information even after they hit the sack. They talked about something called dream incorporation, which refers to the act of incorporating aspects of your external environment into your dreams. Because insomniacs fall asleep in a hyper-aroused state, they incorporate more elements from their environments into their dreams than normal sleepers. </p>
<p><strong>8. Sleep can help you recover from depression</strong></p>
<p>Patients with comorbid depression and insomnia who sleep at least 7 hours nightly are more likely to benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy than those who sleep less. The research shows that sleeping more before starting treatment can increase your chances of recovering from depression and insomnia. </p>",,6/27/2017 17:40,8-things-we-learned-from-sleep-2017-conference,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-510230496.jpg?v=1498601562,,open,open,Uncategorized,Trending
Study Finds Lack Of Sleep Could Hurt Your Relationship,170396483,"<p>We all know that being sleep deprived makes you irritable, but to what extent? New research from The Ohio State University Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research suggests that sleeping less causes you to behave more negatively during a conflict. It also puts you at risk for stress-related inflammation. Specifically, <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170626105142.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">the study</a> focused on couples. The research team recruited 43 couples who would provide blood samples, answer questions about their sleep habits, and then try to resolve a topic that sparks conflict in their relationship. </p>
<p>When both partners slept less than seven hours the night before, they were much more reactive during the conflict, and responded to each other with increased hostility, criticism, and contempt. For every hour of sleep lost, the researchers found that levels of two known inflammatory markers rose 6 percent. Higher levels of these inflammatory factors have been linked to a higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis. </p>
<p>The study reported that half of the couples had slept less than the recommended seven hours, which is higher than the current national average. The CDC reports 35% of Americans get less than seven hours of sleep. </p>
<p>The good news is that if one partner was well-rested, the disagreements tended to be neutralized. This just one more reason why getting enough sleep should be prioritized. Better sleep brings happier marriages! </p>",,6/27/2017 11:09,study-finds-lack-of-sleep-could-hurt-your-relationship,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-649757496.jpg?v=1498576151,,open,open,Uncategorized,Trending

A Cognitive Scientist Created A Drug-Free Trick To Put You To Sleep,169946243,"<p>Can't sleep? We might finally have a solution for you. Luc Beaudoin, a cognitive scientist from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, invented a method to help people fall asleep.</p>
<p>When people struggle to fall asleep, they usually think about not being able to sleep, which then makes it even harder to fall asleep. He came up with a technique called ""<a href=""https://mysleepbutton.com/support/do-it-yourself-cognitive-shuffle-sdi/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">cognitive shuffling</a>,"" which is meant to distract the brain and lull it into that groggy state that proceeds a sleep cycle.</p>
<p><strong>How do you do the cognitive shuffle?</strong> </p>
<p>It's a simple word game that you play in your head. Pick a word that contains at least five letters. Take the first letter, and create a new list of words that begin with it, then vividly picture each in your mind. When you run out of ideas, move on to the next letter. When you finish all of those letters, think of a new word. </p>
<p>Let's try it out: </p>
<p><strong style=""background-color: #ffff00;"">CARING</strong></p>
<p>Which starts with the letter ""C"" so:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cat, camp, candy, Christmas, cow. . .</em></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The next letter in CARING is ""A"" so:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Apple, avenue, angel, athlete. . .</em></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If you don't feel like doing all that thinking, you can download his app  <a href=""https://mysleepbutton.com/home/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">mySleepButton</a>. Turn it on, close your eyes, and listen to a voice read out a list of random things. Imagine them in your mind as you fall asleep. For example, you might hear ""a girl adjusting her ponytail"" followed by ""a child talking to Superman."" Seems odd, but the mix of these mental images distracts the conscious brain while your body gets on with the natural process of drifting off to sleep. </p>",,6/8/2017 17:30,a-cognitive-scientist-created-a-drug-free-trick-to-put-you-to-sleep,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/AdobeStock_125691120.jpeg?v=1496957641,,open,open,Uncategorized,Trending
A Brief History Of The Mattress,169880579,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Beds are a place to unwind and get some rest at the end of a long day. Most of us probably don’t think much about the everyday item that plays such a big role in our lives. But the mattress has come a long way to be what it is today. Read below for a brief timeline of how the mattress has evolved. </span></p>
<p><b>10,200 B.C.E:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> The very first bed is invented. These beds likely were made with materials like leaves, grass, and whatever was plentiful in nature covered in animal hides. Imagine how tired our ancestors must have been after constructing their own mattresses!</span></p>
<p><b>3,400 B.C.E: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Egyptians sleep on piles of palm branches.</span></p>
<p><b>200 B.C.E: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Romans take it up a notch by stuffing materials like straw and wool inside of cloth to sleep on.</span></p>
<p><b>Early 18th century: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mattresses are now stuffed with wool or cotton.</span></p>
<p><b>1857: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The coil spring, integral to the innerspring mattress, is invented.</span></p>
<p><b>1871: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The first innerspring mattress is created.</span></p>
<p><b>End of 19th century: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The first box springs are invented.</span></p>
<p><b>1929: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Latex rubber mattresses are produced.</span></p>
<p><b>1930s:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Pocket spring mattresses are first introduced.</span></p>
<p><b>1960s: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Waterbeds are introduced to consumers.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Next time you crawl into bed feeling exhausted, be glad you didn’t have to spend all day building your own mattress! </span></p>",,6/6/2017 18:03,a-brief-history-of-the-mattress,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/who-invented-the-mattress-e1464982512390-1.jpg?v=1496843234,,open,open,Uncategorized,Culture
Foam Vs. Gel Mattresses,169848771,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It can be challenging enough deciding between an innerspring or a foam mattress. But when you throw gel in the mix, the decision can become even more confusing. Eight is here to help. Here are the differences to consider between a foam and a gel mattress:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Materials</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Both foam and gel mattresses are made from viscoelastic, a material that reacts to weight and body temperature. Gel foam mattresses, however, are infused with, what else, gel. This gel is often throughout the entire mattress but sometimes is only found in one layer.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight is unique in that it has four high density foam layers that make up the mattress.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">–2” of latex-like foam (responds like latex but provides better support and breathability)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">–2” of memory foam (provides the right comfort and support)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">–2” of transition foam (equally distributes weight and lets the mattress adapt better to your sleep position)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">–4” of support foam (guarantees the right support and durability of the mattress)</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Foam</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Foam mattresses like Eight’s mattress provide support to your entire body so you never wake up feeling sore. Foam does not transfer movement easily, so you won’t be disturbed by a partner’s tossing and turning. Memory foam is the perfect balance between firm and soft. Memory foam mattresses not made with the right type of foam can cause people to sleep warm.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Gel</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The main difference from foam mattresses is the inclusion of gel. Gel added to foam allows heat to escape that in poorly made memory foam mattresses could cause you to become too hot during the night, making it hard to sleep.  Gel mattresses feel cool when you first lay down on them, but that feeling may only last a  few minutes since the gel takes on the temperature of the environment it is in.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The Verdict</b></p>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The main difference between the two types of mattresses is in heat retention. Gel infused foam mattresses aim to make you sleep cooler, but they do not necessarily stay cool.  Our mattress is designed to stay cool overnight thanks to its premium materials and composition.  If you purchase a top quality foam mattress like the Eight mattress, there is no need for gel in the mattress. Still can’t decide which type of mattress is right for you? Sleep on it. Eight offers a 100 night trial for you to try our unique foam mattress for yourself. </span>",,6/5/2017 16:08,foam-vs-gel-mattresses,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/white_bed.png?v=1496693377,,open,open,Uncategorized,Product
Sleep Improves For Fathers As Kids Grow Older,169842563,"<p>Following our preliminary research on <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/mothers-experience-more-sleep-challenges-than-fathers"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">the quality of sleep for parents</a>, which found that fathers get less sleep than mothers, we analyzed the data again to explore what other factors may affect the quality of a father's sleep. We found that for fathers with children ages 0 to 5 years, their sleep suffered significantly more than for those with teenage children ages 15 to 20. </p>
<script src=""//cdn.playbuzz.com/widget/feed.js""></script>
<div class=""pb_feed"" data-shares=""false"" data-comments=""false"" data-game-info=""false"" data-item=""59286977-a4c1-4721-a7c9-31671590ba97"" data-embed-by=""24bd3a4f-148f-43e6-96f5-91e22755ebd6"" data-version=""2""></div>
<p>After analyzing survey responses in correlation to the true sleep data collected from our sleep tracking technology, we learned that fathers with children under 5 years old had lower sleep scores than fathers with children ages 15 to 20. Men with younger children had an average sleep score of 69 while men with older children had a sleep score of 74. That is a 5 point difference! When self-reporting their sleep quality, men with younger children were less likely to rate their sleep as restful, with 44% saying their sleep quality was ""good"" compared to 65% of fathers with older children. </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Other factors were considered, such as occupation and marital status, but those did not have a notable impact on a father’s sleep. Being married or in a domestic partnership had a slight significance that deserves to be mentioned. On average, 47% of married fathers rated their sleep as “good” compared to 39% of divorced fathers. Married fathers also slept the longest with 7 hours 23 minutes while divorced fathers only slept an average of 6 hours 24 minutes. Moreover, divorced fathers had the lowest sleep score -  61.5. Despite this stark contrast, further analysis is required due to a skewed number of married participants. </span></p>
<p>The conclusions from this report confirm previous studies about fatherhood and sleep. According to a <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/04/05/473002684/for-new-parents-dad-may-be-the-one-missing-the-most-sleep"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">2013 study</a>, new fathers missed more sleep than mothers. Of 21 mother-father pairs enjoying their first infant experience, fathers actually got less sleep than the mothers and experienced more confirmed sleepiness. The good news is that sleep gets better with age. As the children grow up, fathers reported higher sleep quality and saw higher sleep scores; whereas, mothers did not follow that pattern.</p>

What the Longest Day of the Year Means for Your Sleep,169822851,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">June 21st is the longest day of the year.  On this day, the tilt of earth’s axis is aligned closely with the sun, giving us the most daylight. The summer solstice marks the onset of summer, and will occur in the northern hemisphere at 12:24am (EST). While that extra daylight is nice for backyard picnics and working outdoors, what does it do to our sleep? </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All that sun exposure can make it hard to sleep. Think about it: your body has become accustomed  to the sun setting around the same time every day and then you going to bed a few hours after that. When the sun sets later, your body’s internal clock will be thrown off. You may find it harder to fall asleep since the light doesn’t align with your natural body clock.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The summer solstice can make sleep even more difficult for those already suffer from sleep issues. The increased daylight does not allow enough melatonin, a key ingredient for sleep, to be produced.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2014/06/20/health-doctors-warn-summer-solstice-could-cause-issues-for-those-who-suffer-with-sleep-problems/""> Melatonin is produced at night, so more daylight means less time for it to be produced.</a></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The good news? The summer solstice can be an opportune time to reset your body clock if you want to get more sleep and start waking up or going to sleep at different times. The earlier sunrise can cause you to wake up earlier, so if you’ve been meaning to catch that 6 AM workout class, the summer solstice may help! However, the later sunset can make you want to stay up longer. Avoid the extra daylight getting in the way of your 8 hours by using blackout shades.</span></p>

Climate Change Is Messing Up Our Sleep,169715139,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We know by now that global warming causes damage to the environment. But can it cause issues with our sleep too?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It turns out that the rising temperatures and increasing levels of carbon dioxide associated with global warming harm both the environment and our sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">People who live in areas with high levels of carbon dioxide in the air, often caused by cars in traffic, tend to experience sleep disruption over time. A study from the University of Washington found that people who lived in areas with the most air pollution are likely to have more trouble sleeping.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Air pollution has also been linked with </span><a href=""https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sleepapnea""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sleep apnea</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, a breathing condition that disrupts sleep. According to author Martha E. Billings in a </span><a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/05/23/air-pollution-could-disrupting-your-sleep/338673001/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">USA Today article</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, “a</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ir pollutants can lead to irritation and inflammation in airways and nasal passages.” When airways and nasal passages become blocked, breathing becomes harder. As anyone with allergies knows, difficulty breathing negatively affects sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And if the air pollution weren’t bad enough, the rise in temperature has been shown to impact sleep as well according to a new article in </span><a href=""http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/5/e1601555""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Science Advances</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Room and body temperature play a key role in falling asleep. If the sleeping environment is too cold or hot, there will be difficulty falling and staying asleep.  Those who do not have air conditioning systems will be affected by sleeplessness caused by global warming.</span></p>

This Is What Happens To Your Brain When You're Sleep Deprived,169714691,"<div>According to a new study, sleep deprivation is way more serious than needing an extra cup of coffee in the morning. Consistently not getting enough sleep significantly harms the brain. The recent study, published in the <a href=""http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/21/5263"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Journal of Neuroscience</a>, suggests that losing sleep causes the brain to ""eat itself."" </div>
<div></div>
<div></div><br>
<div>Researchers led by Michele Bellesi of the Marche Polytechnic University in Italy studied the brains of mice who were well-rested and who were sleep-deprived.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div><br>
<div>They analyzed the brains of mice that had regular sleep, spontaneous wake, sleep deprivation, and chronic sleep restriction (no sleep for over 5 days). Specifically, they looked at the mice's glial cells, which help clean up the brain and support the neurons. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div><br>
<div>One type of glial cell - an astrocyte - rids the brain of extraneous synapses in an effort to rewire and rejuvenate it. Another, called a microglial cell, is meant to destroy old cells via a process called phagocytosis. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div><br>
<div>Sleep-deprived mice had more active astrocytes than well-rested mice (13.5% synapse activity compared to 5.7%). To put it simply, portions of synapses, or connections, were being eaten by astrocytes due to sleep-deprivation. However, breaking down brain debris may not necessarily be a bad thing. This finding requires a lot more research to fully understand the phenomenon. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div><br>
<div>The experiment also looked at the effect of sleep deprivation the microglial cells, which account for around 15% of cells in the brain. They found that chronic sleep restriction led to increased signs of microglial activation, which may lead to serious brain diseases such as Alzheimer's. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div><br>

How to Become a Morning Person,169707779,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We get it; waking up early sounds about as appealing as squeezing onto the subway during the morning commute.  Some people naturally thrive in the mornings while others prefer to sleep in. But just because you aren’t naturally a morning person doesn’t mean you can’t become one.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Waking up early in the morning gives you more time to accomplish tasks. So if you’re feeling overwhelmed with a busy schedule, you have all the more reason to follow these tips to become a morning person.</span></p>
<p><b>Positivity is everything</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tell yourself you </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">can </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">do this; you will become a morning person! Do something in the morning that makes you actually want to get out of bed. Dedicate 10 minutes or so every morning to watching your favorite show or listening to your favorite album. Listening to uplifting tunes can also help awaken your senses and set a positive tone for the day. But...</span></p>
<p><b>Don’t overwhelm the senses immediately</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Start the day by doing one small activity at a time.  Don’t immediately start multitasking, but rather ease your brain into daytime activities. If you do listen to music in the morning, start out with some calm coffee shop acoustic before listening to </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Crazy Train.</span></i></p>
<p><b>Go to bed early</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This sounds like a no-brainer, but it can be trickier than you think. You may feel you have a lot of work left to do before bed, but know that the extra few hours you’ll gain by waking up early the next morning will give you plenty of time to finish. Set an alarm reminding yourself when it’s time to get ready for bed. Eventually, it will become second nature, and you will no longer need the reminder.</span></p>
<p><b>Ease into it and stick to a schedule </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Don’t try to go from waking up at 8am to 6am in one day. Wake up a half hour earlier each day until you reach your desired wake up time. Once you’re there, stick to it! Also, try not to sleep in too late on the weekends. Eight’s app and sleeptracker lets you track your sleep so you know what time you’re actually waking up each morning.</span></p>
<p><b>Let it shine</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Keep the shades in your bedroom half open. It is much easier to wake up to some natural light, and this way you won’t go blind when you open the shades and all the light enters at once.</span></p>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Follow these simple tips, and you’ll be an early riser before you know it!</span>",,5/30/2017 12:25,how-to-become-a-morning-person,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/woman_waking_up_bright.jpeg?v=1496161508,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
Why You Can’t Sleep Late Anymore,169707651,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s finally the weekend, and the thing you’re looking forward to the most isn’t the night out with friends, the days off of work, or even the Friday night special at your favorite bar. You’re most excited to finally sleep in. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even though many of us want to sleep in on days off, as we grow older we find that we can’t. So what gives?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As we get older, we need less sleep. </span><a href=""https://sleepfoundation.org/excessivesleepiness/content/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need-0""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Infants sleep considerably more than those middle aged and above</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">; it’s only natural. Most adults only need 8 hours of sleep a night. Trying to force your body to sleep in past those 8 hours doesn’t usually work too well.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What’s more, even if you don’t set an alarm, your body acts as a natural alarm clock. Our bodies get accustomed to waking up at the same time during the week for those of us who have 9-5 jobs, and our body’s internal clock does not differentiate between weekends and weekdays.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It can be frustrating to naturally wake up early on weekends and holidays, but it’s actually a good thing.You may not be able to clock extra hours of weekend sleep, but the bright side is once your body gets used to a routine, it makes it easier to wake up early in the mornings. Your body is no longer fighting with you to make that 9am meeting, so be thankful.</span></p>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We all have weekend projects waiting to get done, so take advantage of those extra hours in the morning! </span>",,5/30/2017 12:21,why-you-can-t-sleep-late-anymore,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/alarm_clock_in_bed.jpeg?v=1496161270,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
8 Habits of Well Rested People,169707267,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ever see those people perky and alert on Monday mornings without a coffee in their hand and wonder just what their secret is? Well it turns out, they have eight secrets. By following the tips below, you too can become a well rested person.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>They maintain a regular sleep schedule </strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The importance of going to bed and waking up at the same time cannot be stressed enough. Try to avoid sleeping in on weekends, as tempting as it may be. </span></p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong>  They enjoy taking naps </strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Naps can help you feel more rested as long as they are 15-35 minutes or a full 90 minutes. Time of day is also crucial when it comes to naps. Nap in the early afternoon and never after 4:30 since it can affect your nighttime sleep. </span></p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong> They do their best to relax before bed</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Eight app features meditation sessions and soothing white noise to help you destress before bed. You won’t be well rested if you’re up all night worrying, so try writing down your concerns in a journal before bed or reading a relaxing book. If you’re having trouble sleeping, imagine a soothing beach or a beautiful landscape. </span></p>

However, some people experience restfulness after vigorous exercise, so avoid pumping iron too close to bedtime. </span></p>
<ol start=""5"">
<li><strong> They don't stress about going to bed late one night</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yes, it’s important to maintain a schedule, but don’t beat yourself up for staying up past your bedtime one night. The stress from this could keep you up even later, so just accept that it is okay and promise yourself you’ll get back on track tomorrow. </span></p>
<ol start=""6"">
<li><strong> They don’t sleep with a pet</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Everyone loves kitten cuddles, but your restless pets could prevent you from getting a good night’s rest. </span><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/05/pets-sleep-sharing-bed_n_5439851.html""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thirty percent of pet owners</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> who sleep with their pet report waking up because of their four-legged friend at least once per night.

</ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can’t expect to be well rested if you don’t appreciate the benefits of being well rested. It’s important to make sleep a priority. Working during the wee hours of the night is a recipe for burnout, not productivity. If you’re feeling tired, put down your laptop a little bit early. Insufficient sleep will impair your performance the next day, so it’s crucial you get a good night’s sleep. </span></p>
<ol start=""8"">
<li><strong> They know when enough is enough</strong></li>

The Pros and Cons of Each Sleeping Position,169628611,"<p>Whether you sleep sprawled out on your back or curled up in a little ball, the position you sleep in can affect the quality of your sleep. Sleep position can play a role in snoring, heartburn, and even wrinkles. And some positions are better than others (sorry, stomach sleepers!) </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Back Sleepers</span> </p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Sleeping on your back is great for the spine and neck because the back is straight and not forced into any contortions. In an ideal world, you'd sleep on your back without any pillows, as this position leaves the neck in a neutral position. Back sleeping also has its cosmetic benefits. Spending all night with your face in the air, as opposed to smooshed into a pillow, leads to fewer facial wrinkles. </p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> For those who snore or suffer from sleep apnea, sleeping on your back will enhance this. Lying on your back causes the back of the tongue to collapse into the airway, which obstructs breathing and creates those beautiful snoring sounds. Doctors suggest side sleeping for people with sleep apnea. </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Side Sleepers</span></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Sleeping on the side is the most common sleep position for a reason. If you are a side sleeper, you should definitely sleep on the left side. It alleviates acid reflux and heartburn, boosts digestion, stimulates the drainage of toxins from the lymph nods, improves circulation, and helps your brain filter out waste. Due to anatomy and the location of your body's organs, these amazing benefits only come from sleeping on the left side. </p>
<p><img src=""https://i1.wp.com/www.healthylifetricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/sleeping-on-the-left-side.jpg?w=600"" alt="""" width=""489"" height=""261"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""></p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Sleeping on the left side can put pressure on the stomach and lungs, so it's best to switch it up. Most notably, side sleepers may experience that dreaded arm numbness from resting on a single arm for too long. Finally, this position puts a lot of stress on the shoulders so if you have shoulder pain, you should not sleep on your side. </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Stomach</span></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Stomach sleeping eases snoring, but that's about it. </p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Sleeping on your stomach is probably the worst sleeping position, especially if you have back problems. It flattens the natural curve of the spine, which can lead to lower back pain. Plus, sleeping all night with your head turned to one side will strain the neck. If you do prefer this position, try sticking a pillow under the hips and lower abdomen to give the bottom of the spine a lift. </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Bottom Line</span></p>
<p>Sleeping is a personal experience, so you should sleep in whichever position is the comfiest for you. If you do suffer from back pain or snore frequently, try switching up your position. It may make a huge difference. The key takeaway is to continue doing what feels right, but if you just ate a huge meal, definitely sleep on your left side! </p>",,5/26/2017 15:47,the-pros-and-cons-of-each-sleeping-position,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-491787015.jpg?v=1495829059,,open,open,Uncategorized,"Culture, Lifestyle"
Our Best Tips For Sleeping In The Heat,169622531,"<p>Basking in the sun all day is great, but no one wants to be baking in their bed at night. Many people have trouble sleeping when it's too hot outside. If the AC isn't cooling you down enough at night (the ideal room temperature is 65-68 degrees Fahrenheit), you may want to read these tips below. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Go cotton </strong></p>
<p>Sheets with natural fibers, like cotton, are the best at keeping you cool at night. Although luxurious high-thread-count sheets sound enticing, the National Sleep Foundation recommends a thread count of 200 to 400. It turns out, the tighter the weave, the less breathable the sheets will be. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p><strong>2. Switch off</strong></p>
<p>Electrical sockets give off a surprising amount of heat. Turning off all the plug sockets can help reduce excess heat (and will save energy!) </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3. Stay low</strong></p>
<p>Remember, heat rises. If you can't get comfortable in your bed, sleep on the floor or downstairs. Maybe better, try a <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">mattress with dynamic cooling</a> - they can go as low as 55 degrees Fahrenheit!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>4. Close your curtains</strong></p>
<p>If there's a heat wave, it is important to close your curtains and blinds during the day. This is pretty self-explanatory, but blocking light from coming in can help keep your room from overheating. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>5. Rinse your wrists</strong></p>
<p>Washing your wrists with cold water or rubbing them with an ice cube before you hit the hay can help you cool down. Cooling your pulse points gradually cools you down by slowing the blood to that area of your body, thus stopping your body from overheating. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>6. Watch what you drink</strong></p>
<p>Boozing before bed is never a good idea, but you should especially avoid it on hot summer nights. Alcohol disrupts sleep and dehydrates. When it's unbearable hot out, it is imperative that you stay hydrated. Keep a cold glass of water by your bed. A cold sip can work wonders when you're overheating. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>7. Take a cold shower</strong></p>
<p>If you can't bring town the temperature in your room, bring down your body temperature. Taking a cold shower will help drop your body temp a few degrees. Slipping into bed when you're nice and clean will also help you drift off to sleep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>8. Go solo</strong></p>
<p>Sorry lovebirds, but sleeping with a partner will increase the overall heat in your bed. If you're sleeping alone, try snoozing in the spread eagle position, which is best for reducing body heat and letting air circulate around the body. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Summer heatwaves can significantly disrupt sleep. At Eight Sleep, we aim to help you sleep better, even in the hottest weather. If you have a Nest thermometer, connect it with your Eight app and set your room to the best temperature for your sleep. </p>",,5/26/2017 13:11,our-best-tips-for-sleeping-in-the-heat,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-74180296.jpg?v=1495820874,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
This One Easy Trick Will Increase Employee Productivity,169600771,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We all want better sleep and to perform to the best of our abilities at work. It turns out that one common element can hinder both: light.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Circadian rhythm is the body's natural clock that aligns with the sun and tells us when it is time to perform basic functions like sleeping and eating. According to a recent article in </span><a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissathompson/2017/05/22/increase-employee-productivity-with-this-one-sleep-hack/2/#10c2ea281a01""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Forbes</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, “Constant light has not only disrupted our natural circadian rhythms, there’s also a surplus of evidence that suggests different types of light can disrupt our natural sleep-wake cycles, our ability to focus, and cause irritability or even depression.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">No one wants unfocused workers, so what’s a boss to do? Well, changing the lighting in the office can increase productivity. Most office lighting is harsh, often fluorescent lighting. They emit a limited light spectrum that messes with our natural circadian rhythm. People need natural light from the sun to stay healthy and focused, not hours of artifical one tone light.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to </span><a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissathompson/2017/05/22/increase-employee-productivity-with-this-one-sleep-hack/2/#10c2ea281a01""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Forbes</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, there are two types of lighting systems that can improve circadian rhythms and help workers focus more: </span><a href=""https://www.halcyon-lighting.co.uk/pages/circadian-lighting""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Circadian lighting </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and </span><a href=""https://energy.gov/energysaver/daylighting""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Daylighting</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p>
<p><b>Circadian Lighting</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It imitates natural daylight and follows the transition of the sun from blue light in the early morning to white light in the afternoon. The white light will signal to your body that it is daytime, and it will increase alertness.</span></p>
<p><b>Daylighting</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This lighting system optimizes natural light that is already entering the room. This system must integrated lights in the room with shades on the window to ensure the proper spectrum of light enters the room.</span></p>
<p><b>Work with what ya got</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If your office building already has plenty of natural light, then there is no need to implement these systems. But if not, figure out which type of lighting is best for your building. If your building does not have a lot of large windows, then use Circadian Lighting. If your building has windows that only a bit of natural light filters through, Daylighting is the best option.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By utilizing one of these two lighting methods, not only will your employees be much more focused, but you’ll save money on electricity by utilizing as much natural light as possible.</span></p>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All of our body’s natural functions are connected, and they are all influenced by light.

How to Sleep Well on Vacation,169600515,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Who doesn’t love a good vacation? New foods, new sights, and new experiences make for a nice break from reality. However, vacation also means a new sleeping environment. Many of us experience difficulties sleeping away from home, but there are measures you can take to ensure a poor night’s sleep doesn’t ruin your trip.</span></p>
<p><b>Consistency is key</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether you’re staying at a hotel or with a friend, </span><b>make your room feel like home</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Pack your favorite slippers, your pillowcase, sleepy time socks, and a picture of your family for the nightstand to make you feel comfortable enough to get a good night’s sleep. If you have a bedtime routine such as drinking tea before bed, make sure to continue that routine while you’re away. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Used to a calming scent before bed? Pack those essential oils! </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Over time, our bodies associate sleep with our nighttime rituals, so taking away those rituals for a week makes it harder for us to fall asleep.</span></p>
<p><b>Eating meals at the same time every day</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> while on vacation can also help your body get into a natural rhythm. Avoid large meals close to bed so you can fall asleep easily and stay asleep.</span></p>
<p><b>Adjust sleep schedules</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re traveling to a different time zone, try to adjust to the new timezone by going to sleep when it is nighttime rather than when you start feeling tired. This will help you adjust to the new time zone so you spend enough time awake during the day to enjoy yourself.</span></p>
<p><b>Location, location, location</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Scoping out the location of where you’ll be staying ahead of time can help ensure a more restful sleep. Is it by a busy road? If you’re staying at a hotel, ask to change rooms if you’re on a noisy ground level. No matter where you’re staying, it’s smart to pack ahead with ear buds and a sleep mask.</span></p>
<p><b>Minimize anxiety</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Relax before bed with a spa treatment or warm bath. Eight’s app features relaxing meditation sessions you can listen to before bed. Writing out the next day's activities and/or discussing them with your travel partners so you don’t have to worry about when you’re doing what the next day is also helpful. If you find yourself feeling uncomfortable in your new environment, read a favorite book or listen to some music before bed to relax yourself.</span></p>

Best Outdoor Spots To Catch Some ZZZ's,169593539,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sun and relaxation: two things summer is known best for. Get the most out of your summer by relaxing in the warm weather in these outdoor spots.</span></p>
<h2><b>Hammocks</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether it’s gently swaying under the shade of a palm tree in Mexico or under your grandparent's oak tree in Michigan, laying in a hammock is a relaxing way to get some rest.</span></p>
<h2><b>Local parks </b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Live in more of an urban jungle than a beach paradise? Not to worry. Grab a shady spot and set up a blanket in your local park if the summer sounds of pickup soccer games lull you to sleep. Not comfy laying on a blanket on the ground? Stack some pillows or bring your own hammock to tie between two trees for an afternoon nap.</span></p>
<h2><b>Balconies or porches</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether in a hotel or on your own porch, you can catch some rays and zzz’s from the comfort of your own space. The best perk of this spot? You can always walk back in to refill that lemonade.</span></p>
<h2><b>Beaches</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The lull of waves put many people to sleep. Pull up a lounge chair so you’re comfortable, lather on the sunscreen, and pull that floppy hat over your eyes to catch some rest. But before you do, read this </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/is-it-safe-to-sleep-in-the-sun""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">article</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to avoid the dangers that can come with sleeping in the sun.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Don’t live by a beach? Many cities have green areas or comfortable recliners by bodies of water.</span></p>
<h2><b>Rooftops</b></h2>

How to Get Back on Track After a Long Weekend,169587011,"<p>Summer holiday weekends in the USA typically consist of backyard barbecues, ice cold booze, and a lot of red white and blue. The extended weekend is a nice break, but staying up late and sleeping in can disrupt our regular sleep schedules.</p>
<p>We’ve all been there: disrupted sleep, forgotten diet, and the rest of the week looming in front of us. Here’s how to get back on track after the long weekend.</p>
<h2>Think positively</h2>
<p>Don’t get discouraged if you can’t fall asleep right away. Believe your sleep will get back on track. Focus on relaxing, but don’t obsess over it. Try not to relive the excitement of the weekend in your mind, but instead try a calming activity like reading to help you fall asleep.</p>
<h2>Hydrate</h2>
<p>Those alcoholic watermelon coolers may have sounded great this weekend, but now you’re regretting them. Wake up feeling refreshed by drinking water before bed to prevent thirst and dehydration disrupting sleep. Make sure to hydrate when you wake up as well.</p>
<h2>Routine, routine, routine</h2>
<p>It’s important to get back to your normal routine as quickly as possible.</p>
<h3>Time your meals</h3>
<p>Over the weekend, eat that burger early between 6-8. Heavy meals close to bedtime can disrupt sleep. But don’t fret if your mealtimes were out of whack over the weekend. To get back on track, try to eat at the same time every day. This will not only help with portion control, but it can help you sleep better. Our bodies’ routines are all connected, so if one thing is off then it can affect something else.</p>
<h3>Wake up and go to bed at the same time</h3>
<p>Most of us tend to stay up later when we know there’s no work the next day. However, this can harm our sleep schedules and make it more difficult to wake up and fall asleep during the week. Try to stick to a strict bedtime and wake up time, and don’t stray from it more than a half hour. Eight’s Smart Alarm on the Eight app can help with this. It wakes you up during your lightest sleep stage within a half hour of you alarm. The Eight app can also tell you when it’s time to go to sleep.</p>
<p>Follow these few simple tips, and you’ll be back to your well rested self in no time!</p>",,5/25/2017 13:04,how-to-get-back-on-track-after-a-long-weekend,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-629588986.jpg?v=1495734194,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
Sleeping Less Can Affect A Man's Sperm,169389315,"<p>Guys listen up, this is important! A recent study, published in <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/articles/28412762/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Medical Science Monitor</a>, found a strong link between how much sleep men were getting and how healthy (and abundant) their sperm were. </p>
<p>The study showed that those falling asleep between 8 and 10 pm had the best sperm motility, meaning the sperm are better swimmers and have a greater chance of fertilizing an egg. Men who go to bed after midnight had the worst sperm motility.</p>
<p>Staying up that extra hour to watch one more episode of <em>House Of Cards</em> has a significant impact on your sperm's health. However, don't go thinking you can just sleep an extra hour to reverse the effects. The study also showed that lying in bed for more than nine hours lowers sperm motility. Nonetheless, men who went to bed after midnight AND got less than 6 hours of sleep saw the lowest sperm counts and sperm survival rates. </p>
<p>Going to bed super late and not getting enough sleep can cause your body to release anti-sperm antibodies (ASA) - a type of protein produced by the immune system which can destroy healthy sperm. In fact, a previous study found that men who get six or less hours of sleep had sperm counts 25% lower than those who slept a full eight hours. </p>
<p>If you needed another reason why sufficient sleep is so important, here you go! Your future children will thank you. </p>",,5/19/2017 16:50,sleeping-less-can-affect-a-mans-sperm,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-200388235-001.jpg?v=1495227042,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
Why Do We Feel So Tired On Mondays?,169372099,"<p>There's a reason why Monday mornings have such a bad rap, and it all has to do with your body's clock. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img src=""https://media3.giphy.com/media/l46Cbqvg6gxGvh2PS/giphy.gif"" alt=""""></p>
<p>The weekend may be fun and relaxing, but it can wreak havoc on your sleep. Staying up later and sleeping in until noon disrupts your sleep schedule and throws your internal clock off. This makes it much harder to fall asleep on Sunday night, which then gives you a case of the ""Monday Blues."" According to a recent survey by <a href=""https://today.yougov.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Yougov</a> on behalf of Calm.com, of 4,279 Americans and Brits polled online in 2017, a full 23% reported that Sunday night was the most difficult night to fall asleep. </p>
<p>Sunday night insomnia is actually due to jet lag, or what experts are calling ""social jet lag."" When you've been going to bed and waking up at different hours than usual, your body just can't adjust properly. You eat on a different schedule on the weekends, exercise differently, and get light exposure later -- all of this delays the circadian rhythm. </p>
<p>To get back on track, here are some tips to make Monday morning great again: </p>
<p>1. <strong>Get a good night's sleep each night during the week</strong>: You don't want to head into the weekend feeling sleep deprived. If you get a solid 7-8 hours each night during the week, a weekend deficit will be easier to handle. </p>
<p>2. <strong>Avoid sleeping in on Saturdays and Sundays</strong>: This one may be tough, but you'll thank us later. If you wake up at the same time every day, including weekends, you will become a much better sleeper. </p>
<p>3. <strong>Take a short nap</strong>: If you stayed out 'til 3 AM, you'll probably require a nap. The key is to nap before 2 PM and limit it to 20-30 minutes so it won't mess with your sleep at night. </p>
<p>4. <strong>Soak up the sun</strong>: Get us much sun as possible in the morning. If the weather permits, go outside. If not, open your curtains or eat breakfast by the window. Light helps keep your circadian rhythm in check and it lowers melatonin levels. Being more awake and alert during the day will help you feel tired come nighttime. </p>
<p>5. <strong>Choose one night for booze</strong>: As you know, alcohol negatively affects sleep, so try and limit your intake on the weekends. If you want to party, choose one night of the weekend instead of both. Friday nights are probably better so that you get all of Saturday and Sunday to recover. </p>
<p>6. <strong>Reduce anxiety</strong>: Another reason for Sunday night sleeping troubles is workweek anxieties. Whether you're worrying about that meeting with your boss or that big deal you have to close, work can be extremely stressful. Try to write down everything you have to that week on a piece of paper before going to bed. This way, these intrusive thoughts won't be bothering you while you're trying to fall asleep. </p>
<p>Mondays are hard, which is why we at Eight want to create the best sleeping environment for you. Our smart alarm detects when you're in your lightest stage of sleep, so waking up is easier. <a href=""eightsleep.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Start sleeping smart today</a>. </p>",,5/19/2017 11:48,why-do-we-feel-so-tired-on-mondays,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-496590873.jpg?v=1495208898,,open,open,Uncategorized,Culture
Is Beauty Sleep A Real Thing? Research Says Yes,169269059,"<p>""I need my beauty sleep,"" you'd declare as your mother aggressively nudged you awake in high school. </p>
<p><img src=""https://media2.giphy.com/media/nQH8CIwU7lyE0/giphy.gif"" alt="""" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""></p>
<p><strong>Well it turns out, you were right! </strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/4/5/160918"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">New research</a> suggests that people who miss out on sleep do appear less attractive to others. In fact, just a few nights of restricted sleep is enough to make a person look ""significantly"" more ugly. In the Stockholm University experiment, 25 participants were photographed after 2 days of sleep restriction and after normal sleep. Then, strangers rated whether they'd socialize with the participant in the photo. They also rated participants' attractiveness, health, sleepiness and trustworthiness. </p>
<p>The results showed that when sleep deprived, the participants were perceived to be less attractive, less healthy, more sleepy - and the raters were less inclined to socialize with them.</p>
<p>The researchers explained this in evolutionary terms saying, ""an unhealthy-looking face, whether due to sleep deprivation or otherwise, might active disease-avoiding mechanisms in others."" In other words, people don't like to hang out with people who look sick. </p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p>Physical attractiveness can affect the way we perceive and treat an individual. Psychologists call this the physical attractiveness stereotype, which is the tendency to assume that people who are attractive possess socially desirable traits. According to various studies, beautiful people are viewed as healthier, more intelligent, and more likable. For example, facial symmetry, a universal sign of beauty, is often perceived as a sign of health, and <a href=""http://psych.colorado.edu/~munakata/teaching/prosem05/ProkoschEtAl05.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">general intelligence</a> is positively linked to body symmetry. </p>
<p>There's a reason why being tired makes you look, well, ugly. Dark circles and bags appear when the body is unable to rejuvenate at night due to lack of sleep. When you sleep, you distribute water in the body. Not getting enough sleep causes water to accumulate under the eyes. Stress, which is linked to lack of sleep, is what really beats you up. When you're tired and stressed, you lose collagen, which makes your face baggy, produces less melanin (making you paler), and leads to wrinkles. </p>

How Making Your Bed Can Help You Sleep at Night,169240451,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It can be tempting to not make your bed every day as it’s just going to get untucked when you go to sleep again at night. What's more, most of us already have busy enough mornings as it is. But making time for making your bed can be extremely beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A survey by </span><a href=""https://sleepfoundation.org/media-center/press-release/americans-bedrooms-are-key-better-sleep-according-new-poll""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The National Sleep Foundation</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> found that people sleep better and longer when their bedrooms are clean.</span></p>
<h2><b>Set the mood</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Going to bed in a clean, relaxed environment can make it easier to fall asleep. An untidy room and untucked sheets cause stress and anxiety that can keep us up at night.</span></p>
<h2><b>Make sleeping easier</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nighttime rituals can help you sleep like turning down your bed every night. Your brain begins to associate the same habit of turning down your bed with sleep, thus making it easier to fall asleep.</span></p>
<h2><b>Sleep, Don’t Sniffle</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you have pets and allergies, you have all the more reason to make your bed every morning. Allergies can keep people up at night, and making your bed can help by preventing pet hair and dust from gathering in your sheets. Even if you don’t suffer from allergies, no one likes being covered in pet hair.</span></p>
<h2><b>Stay Productive</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not only can making your bed help you sleep, but it can also encourages you to be more productive throughout the day. So start tomorrow off on a positive note by making your bed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Of course, one of the most important sleep factors remains sleeping on a comfortable mattress.  Try our Eight Smart Mattress for 108 nights for a better sleep.</span></p>",,5/16/2017 14:56,how-making-your-bed-can-help-you-sleep-at-night,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-598566816.jpg?v=1494961919,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
Why Do We Sweat At Night?,169236035,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sweating at night can be embarrassing and uncomfortable. It can also lead to an awful lot of laundry days for all those sweat-drenched clothes. So why do some people tend to sweat during the night?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let’s start with the basics. Sweating is our bodies’ natural way to cool us down and prevent overheating. There are many possible causes of sweating at night, some more serious than others. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>Moderate and/or not sweating every night</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you moderately sweat during the night, it may simply be a sign that your sleeping environment is too warm. Lower the temperature in your room at night or the temperature of your bed with the Eight app. The ideal bedroom temperature is 65-68 degrees Fahrenheit. Opening the windows for a breeze if you don’t suffer from allergies or turning a fan on could also help alleviate some sweat.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One major culprit to bed-sweaters is the mattress you’re sleeping on. Certain designs trap in heat and moisture, which prevents your body from regulating its temperature like it wants to. Sleeping hot is one of the biggest complaints from memory foam mattresses, which is why we created something better. <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">The Pod by Eight Sleep</a> offers dynamic cooling paired with premium breathable foam layers. The result is a cool and comfortable mattress for you to sleep on all summer long.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another obvious fix is to sleep in breathable sheets.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> ﻿﻿</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Applying deodorant before bed can also aid in reducing sweat at night. Since sweating is our bodies’ way of telling us we’re getting too hot, make sure to drink a glass of water before bed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Besides a high room temperature, a number of medications also have side effects that include sweating at night, so make sure to read the label on your pills. Additionally, low blood sugar can cause sweating at night.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>Excessive sweating nightly or almost every night</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you find yourself sweating excessively every night, then it could be a sign of something more serious like tuberculosis, HIV, or sleep apnea among other things. Menopause and pregnancy can also cause women to sweat excessively during the night. Consult your doctor for treatment options.</span></p>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can try our Eight Smart Mattress for 108 nights to see for yourself how cool it sleeps. </span>",,5/16/2017 12:58,why-do-we-sweat-at-night,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-475273178.jpg?v=1494956361,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
How Exercise Can Help You Sleep Better,169233347,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We all know by now that sleeping and exercise are good for us, but just how do they relate to one another?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It turns out, exercise is a key factor in improving sleep quality. In a 2013 survey conducted by </span><a href=""https://sleepfoundation.org/media-center/national-sleep-foundation-poll-finds-exercise-key""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The National Sleep Foundation</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, “</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Self-described exercisers report better sleep than self-described non-exercisers even though they say they sleep the same amount each n</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ight.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to </span><a href=""https://sleep.org/articles/exercise-affects-sleep/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleep.org</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, as little as 10 minutes of aerobic activity a day can improve the quality of your sleep. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Exercise helps to reduce stress and can tire you out, but you might want to think twice before exercising too late at night. When you exercise, your body temperature increases. So after exercising, your body temperature decreases which can induce sleep. But if you try to go to bed too quickly after exercising, usually within an hour and a half, your heart rate and temperature could still be up, which often makes it difficult to fall and stay asleep. Everyone is unique, so if you find that exercise before bed does not affect your sleep, then drop and give me 20!  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Always make sure to do cool down stretches after exercising as this can help relax you and make it easier to fall asleep.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While exercise certainly affects sleep, the results may not be felt immediately. In many </span><a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sleep-newzzz/201309/better-sleep-found-exercising-regular-basis-0""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">studies</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, it took weeks, sometime even months, before exercisers reported better sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While exercise’s effect on sleep is not immediate, the effects of sleep on exercise are. Sleep and exercise have a two way relationship; not getting a good night’s sleep can negatively impact your workout the following day.</span></p>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The bottom line is that exercise is just as important as sleep in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So stick with it! </span>",,5/16/2017 11:48,how-exercise-can-help-you-sleep-better,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/tennis_shoes_in_bed.jpeg?v=1494953307,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
Is it Safe to Sleep in the Sun?,169233219,"<p>Summertime means rest, relaxation, and maybe some refreshing wine coolers. After some fun in the sun, you may find yourself starting to doze off in your favorite lawn chair or on the beach while tanning. But how safe is it to fall asleep in the sun?</p>
<p>From a sleep point of view, there are many benefits of naps. They can relax you and give you more energy. But staying in the sun too long can leave you feeling tired, taking away many benefits of napping.  </p>
<p>If you’re going to be out in the sun anyway, it’s fine to take a short nap as long as you have a person or alarm to wake you up so you don’t sleep too long and burn.  Normally, the ideal nap should be 15-35 minutes or a full 90 minutes. Otherwise, you’ll wake up feeling groggy. But your sun siesta should not last longer than a half hour. Why?  Laying in the sun can cause dehydration, and going over an hour without water in the hot sun can be unsafe. You should also check every half hour to see if you need to apply more sunscreen. Take it from someone who has woken up looking like a tomato too many times: always apply sunscreen that is at least 20 SPF before you nap.</p>
<p>Remember that UV rays are highest from <a href=""http://www.sunsafetyalliance.org/uv_rays.html"">10am-4pm</a>, and the sun gets harsher throughout the day. So an early morning nap or a sunset snooze are best. Be sure to wear sunglasses or put a shirt or towel over your face to protect your eyes from the sun as well.</p>
<p>Nap smart and safely this summer by following these tips.</p>",,5/16/2017 11:45,is-it-safe-to-sleep-in-the-sun,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/woman_asleep_by_lake.jpeg?v=1494949516,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle

The Benefits Of Owning A Smart Home,169231363,"<p>Imagine a home smarter and more efficient than you that can cook, clean, and lock the doors among many other things.  While this may sound like the plot of a futuristic movie, it’s actually the reality for more and more people. With all the recent advancements in technology, it’s no wonder that our homes can be smarter than us. Add in the Eight Smart Bed, and your home will be the smartest one on the block.</p>
<p>There are a number of benefits that come with owning a smart home.</p>
<p>One of the biggest upsides of having a smart home is that <strong>you can connect all your devices to one another easily. </strong>This is usually done using <a href=""https://content.eightsleep.com/2017/04/06/what-is-ifttt/"">IFTTT</a>, a free app and website that allows you to connect all of your smart technology and apps.  Never thought your bed could make your coffee? The future is here, friends.</p>
<p>Another major perk of smart homes? <strong>You can control everything from one place</strong>: your smartphone. You don’t have to worry about learning any new, complicated controls. Controlling your smart home with the tap of a finger makes owning a smart home <strong>easy and convenient.</strong></p>
<p>Smart homes can also <strong>save you time</strong>. Connecting your Eight Smart Bed to your WeMo coffeemaker for example can save you time in the morning. Let your smart devices do the work for you.</p>
<p>Everything is uniquely fit for your lifestyle so you get your money’s worth on all of your products. Smart homes also <strong>save you money</strong> by automatically turning devices and lights off when they are not being used or when the room is empty.  </p>
<p>Since they save energy and don’t waste electricity, smart homes are also <strong>efficient and good for the planet.</strong> The Eight Smart Bed connects with Nest thermostat to automatically adjust to your optimal room temperature for sleeping, so your heating or cooling system doesn’t run more than you need. Since Eight Smart Beds also have a warming system, you can turn your bedroom heat off in the winter.</p>
<p>From shutting off the stove to locking doors to making sure your bed warming does not stay on too long, smart homes look out for you. They are <strong>safer than traditional homes.</strong> </p>
Smart homes are the smart choice, and no smart home is complete without a smart bed. Integrate all of the apps and smart devices in your home with Eight using IFTTT.

How A Smart Bed Helps You Sleep Better,169203395,"<p>Each person sleeps differently, so in order to sleep well, you need a bed that can be made unique to you. Smart beds like Eight’s cater to your sleep and help you sleep better by identifying and fixing the factors that can negatively affect sleep.</p>
<p>Wondering what the Eight Smart Bed can do for you? Keep on reading. . .</p>
<h2></h2>
<strong>1. It perfects the temperature</strong>
<p>Brides aren’t the only ones who hate cold feet. Sleeping at the wrong temperature can prevent or disrupt sleep. Eight’s Smart Bed can tell you what temperature you sleep best at, and you can adjust it accordingly. Eight’s smart bed also has a warming feature that can be adjusted individually on each side of the bed so you achieve the right bed temperature for optimal sleep. The app also measures the temperature of your room so you know what the temperature should be in order to rest well. </p>
<p><strong>2. It identifies factors that affect sleep</strong></p>
<p>Eight’s Smart Bed gives you a detailed report of your sleep each night. If your sleep is frequently disrupted, Eight’s app shows you how to sleep better. The unique energy experiment in the app monitors energy inputs such as sleep, caffeine, and exercise during the day to help you better understand your sleep. Using this information, it also calculates the exact amount of sleep you need to feel your best. </p>
<p><strong>3. It helps you fall and stay asleep</strong></p>
<p>It can be hard to fall asleep listening to your partner’s snores or late night sirens. Eight’s Smart Bed makes it easy to block out these noises. It connects to the Eight app which features a variety of relaxing white noises known to induce a peaceful snooze. </p>
<p><strong>4. It provides information so you know which sleeping position is right for you</strong></p>
<p>The sleep tracking feature on the Eight app allows you to see your time slept and how much you tossed and turned during the night. If you find you’re tossing and turning a lot when you sleep in one position, the smart bed allows you to see when it’s time to try a new sleeping position. </p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p><strong>5. It wakes you up lightly</strong></p>
<p>The unique Eight smart alarm wakes you up in your lightest sleep stage within a half hour of when you set your alarm, so you wake up feeling refreshed, not groggy. We believe that a good night's sleep ends in the morning. We built a product that will help you wake up feeling great. </p>
<p><strong>6. It integrates into your life</strong></p>
<p>The Eight Smart Bed comes with a smart cover that fits onto your bed like a fitted sheet. Connect it to your WiFi and you're ready to go. Nothing to wear around your wrist or charge at night. All you have to do is lie down on bed. The Eight Smart Bed seamlessly integrates with almost any smart product in your home, like your Nest or smart coffee maker. A bed that starts brewing your coffee when you get up? Count us in! </p>

Why Do We Toss and Turn At Night?,169189699,"<p>None of us have a perfect night’s sleep every night. But why do some of us toss and turn nearly every night?</p>
<p>The Eight app uses data from the sensors in the Sleep Tracker to tell you how much you toss and turn each night. If you toss and turn for a minute, it is recorded. Anything under a minute is not recorded because it does not significantly impact sleep. In the past week alone, the average person tossed and turned 37-40 times each night.  </p>
<h2>Causes</h2>
<p>If you find yourself constantly moving during the night, alcohol or evening coffee may be the cause. Alcohol and caffeine before bed can lead to a restless sleep. Another possibility is that your bedroom is too warm or there is too much light in it.</p>
<p>Pain can also make it difficult to sleep, so if you’re experiencing chronic pain in any part of your body, it may be the reason you’re tossing and turning so much.</p>
<p>Other possible culprits? Restless leg syndrome or s<a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/why-stomach-sleeping-is-a-major-pain"">leeping on your stomach</a>. Stomach sleeping can lead to neck and back pain that causes tossing and turning.</p>
<p>Everyday worrying can also lead to feeling restless at night. However, tossing and turning could be the result of something more serious, like sleep apnea or depression. Consult your doctor if you have serious concerns.</p>
<p>Tossing and turning can lead to an interrupted sleep and not enough time spent in deep sleep. You can wake up feeling like you didn’t sleep at all. There are a number of steps you can take to reduce the amount of time you spend tossing and turning each night.</p>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<p>Start with these easy fixes if you’re not sure the reason for your restless sleep.</p>
<p>-Avoid alcohol and caffeine after early afternoon</p>
<p>-Monitor the temperature of your bed and bedroom. The Eight app allows you to view this information. Adjust the temperature until you find you’re sleeping better.</p>
<p>-Invest in thick blinds or wear a sleep mask</p>
<p>-Avoid sleeping on your stomach or use a pillow under your stomach</p>
<p>-Write your daily worries down in a journal before bed</p>
<p>If your restless nights are the result of pain, talk to your doctor about medication to reduce your pain.</p>
<p>If you’re one of the<a href=""http://www.healthline.com/health/restless-leg-syndrome/treatments#overview1""> 15% of Americans</a> with Restless Leg Syndrome, massaging your legs before bed and alternating between a warm and cold pack on your legs can help improve sleep.</p>
<p>Remember it’s better to get out of bed if you can’t sleep and do a relaxing activity than to lay there awake for hours. For a smarter sleep, use the Eight App to track your tosses and turns and follow these tips to combat them.</p>",,5/15/2017 11:46,why-we-toss-and-turn-at-night,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/man_staring_at_alarm.jpeg?v=1494863188,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
The Difference Between Light and Deep Sleep,169186755,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It can’t be argued that a night’s sleep is an important time for our bodies to recover and re-energize. That being said, most of us have different sleep experiences each night, and as a result, may wake up still feeling tired, or if we’re lucky, will open our eyes feeling energetic and ready for the day. Most people would attribute the quality of their rest to what kind of sleeper they are. This brings us to light sleepers vs. deep sleepers. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You’ve probably heard of self-proclaimed “light sleepers” being awoken by the faintest noise</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> or experiencing sleepless nights from difficulty falling asleep. Meanwhile, proclaimed deep sleepers </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">could sleep through a screaming baby using a jackhammer. But everyone experiences both light and deep sleep</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in their circadian rhythm</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. So what </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">does this mean and what </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">exactly is the difference </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">between the two</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">? </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Light sleep and deep sleep are two different stages of sleep that everyone experiences. Each sleep stage serves an important role in regulating your circadian rhythm so that you will feel well-rested in the morning. Additionally, each stage has an effect on your dreams, overall brain function, and repairs your body for the next day. Read on to learn more about light and deep sleep and what happens during each stage. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>LIGHT SLEEP</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Light sleep is a non-REM stage, and it’s easiest to wake up during this stage. It occurs in stages 1-2. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Light sleep may not sound very important, but it is a part of our sleep cycle that we need to wake up feeling refreshed. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The first stage of light sleep is a transition phase and only makes up about</span><a href=""https://www.tuck.com/light-sleep/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> 3% </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">of our total time asleep; most light sleep happens in the second stage. The second stage of light sleep consists of over half of our time asleep each night. We </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">are able to fall asleep and </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">dream during this stage, but the dreams are not as intense as they are during REM sleep.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Typically as people age, they spend more time each night in light sleep. There </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> no specific amount of time needed in this phase since it’s not as refreshing as deep sleep. However, </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">light sleep</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">still</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> a necessary sleep stage for proper brain functioning.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>DEEP SLEEP</b></h2>
<p><a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sleepless-in-america/201010/the-mysterious-benefits-deep-sleep""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Psychology Today</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> defines deep sleep as “... a time of nearly complete disengagement from the environment.” </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A deeper</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> sleep is also known as delta sleep, slow wave sleep or N3. It is a restorative sleep state where dreams do not occur, and still relatively little is known about it.  What we do know is that deep sleep is the third stage of sleep. During this stage, </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">your </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">heart rate and breathing slow </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">down</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and your muscles relax to the point where you barely move. Deep sleep is necessary for your body </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and skin</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to repair itself and recharge for the next day. Your organs detoxicate, your kidneys clean your blood, and your body replaces cells, heals wounds, and builds muscle tissues as well. Most deep sleep happens in the first sleep cycle. If someone is </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">woken up</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> during deep sleep, he or she will usually feel disoriented for sometime after waking up. It can be very difficult to wake a person during deep sleep</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> levels.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to </span><a href=""http://www.newhealthadvisor.com/How-Much-Deep-Sleep-Do-You-Need.html""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">New Health Advisor</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, adults 18 and older need anywhere from 1.5-1.8 hours of deep sleep per night, which is about 20% of your overall sleep. Some people, however, may find they need more in order to feel fully rested</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and consider it a good night’s sleep</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After all, </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">there’s no such thing as too much deep sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Understanding light sleep and deep sleep and how long you are in each stage every night can be helpful for you to monitor your sleep patterns. Monitoring this can be useful for your nightly recovery so that you always wake up feeling well-rested and ready to conquer your day.  </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Want to understand how much deep and light sleep you </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">a</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">re getting </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">but are unsure how to keep track</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">? The Eight Sleep </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pod</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> seamlessly tracks your sleep stages, duration and quality.

How Allergies Affect Your Sleep,168957891,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Seasonal changes are the worst for people with allergies. Allergies can make it difficult to sleep. Nasal passageways swell up and become clogged which often leads to an unrestful night of snoring.<a href=""https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/sleep-related-problems/allergic-rhinitis-and-sleep""> This can lead to fatigue and sleepiness during the day.</a> Not being well rested can also lead to more serious effects like <a href=""https://sleep.org/articles/household-allergens-and-sleep/"">depression and memory issues</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3576835/"">study</a>, 48% of people who suffer from </span><span>allergic rhinitis (seasonal allergies) say their allergies interfere with their sleep. </span>But there are ways to combat the sneezing and wheezing that wake you up at night. Read below for tips to sleep soundly this allergy season. </p>
<p><b>Tip #1:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Use a nasal rinse before bed since allergies can worsen during the night and prevent a good night’s rest.</span></p>
<p><b>Tip #2:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Make sure to clean or change the filter in your air conditioning units. If your air conditioner’s filter goes unchecked for long periods of time, dust that triggers allergies can accumulate. </span></p>
<p><b>Tip #3:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Consider closing the windows. Cracking your windows to let in a breeze can be a nice alternative to air conditioning in the warmer months. But if you find that too much pollen accumulates in your room, consider closing the window a few hours before bedtime. </span></p>
<p><b>Tip #4:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Don’t put the clothes you were wearing outside during the day on your bed. Pollen and other particles can cling to them and potentially transfer over to your sheets. This can trigger allergies that make sleeping difficult.</span></p>
<p><b>Tip #5: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Turn your humidifier off to prevent the air from being too moist. Too much moisture and humidity can </span><a href=""http://pingi.com/the-10-must-knows-about-moisture-problems/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">potentially lead to allergies</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and worsening of asthma-related breathing issues. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Allergies no doubt cause sleep disruptions. By using the Sleep Tracker with the Eight App, you'll be able to see how long you were up at night because of allergies and how much you tossed and turned. You can use that data to know how often you should be trying the above tips.</span></p>
<p>With all the pollen in the air, the warmer months can be challenging enough during the day for many people with allergies.  Make things easier on yourself by following these sleep tips!</p>",,5/11/2017 15:53,how-allergies-affect-your-sleep,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/pollen.jpeg?v=1494532563,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mattress shopping can be overwhelming, and there are many questions to consider before purchasing. Eight is here to help. One of the most basic and important questions is whether you should invest in a mattress made with springs, foam, or something totally different. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Deciding which mattress is best depends on many personal factors.  People are unique, and what type of bed works for one person might not be the best fit for another person.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While spring mattresses may have been the long time classic, foam mattresses like the Eight Smart Bed are quickly becoming the leading choice. </span></p>
<p><b>Factors to Consider:</b></p>
<p>   -Age</p>
<p>   -Weight</p>
<p>   -Budget</p>
<p>   -Back pain, neck pain, and/or arthritis</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Read below to see the benefits of sleeping on a multi-layer foam mattress like the Eight foam mattress versus sleeping on a mattress with springs.</span></p>
<h2>
<b>Spring Mattress</b> </h2>
<p>-Transfers movement easily</p>
<p>-Provide breathability</p>
<p>-Attracts more dust mites</p>
<p>-Typically cheaper, but the cheap ones are poor in quality</p>
<p>-Provides support</p>
<p>-More likely to sag</p>
<p>-More likely to attract dust mites</p>
<h2><b>Foam Mattress</b></h2>
<p>-Does not easily transfer movement, ideal if you are sleeping with a partner who tosses and turns during the night</p>
<p>-Provides proper posture support</p>
<p>-Contours to your body, good for all body masses</p>
<p>-Provides pressure relief, ideal for people with pressure points and older people with joint pain</p>
<p>-Does not attract dust mites</p>
<p>-Evenly distributes body weight which allows for increased blood flow</p>
<h2><b>Hybrid Mattress</b></h2>
<p>-Improved airflow making it more breathable</p>
<p>-Pressure relieving while still having bounce</p>
<p>-Ideal for sufferers of back pain and those with a heavier body mass</p>
<p>-Does not attract dust mites since the coils are boxed within foam</p>
<p>-Does not easily transfer movement</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To ensure you get the best quality sleep, all the above factors must be taken into account. Overall, foam mattresses are better than innerspring, but deciding between a hybrid and a foam mattress is a personal decision. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""></span></p>",,5/11/2017 14:31,is-a-foam-mattress-better-than-a-spring-mattress,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/AdobeStock_85604301.jpeg?v=1494530532,,open,open,Uncategorized,"Lifestyle, Product"

<h1>Women</h1>
<p>According to <a href=""https://sleep.org/articles/sleep-for-men-and-women/"">Sleep.org</a>,</p>
<p>-Women need more sleep, about 20 minutes more than men. Women use more mental energy daily, so they need more time for their brains to regenerate</p>
<p>-Approximately 15% of women report having sleep troubles</p>
<p>-Menopause, pregnancy, and menstrual cycles make it harder for women to sleep</p>
<p>-Women experience insomnia at double to triple the rate of men</p>
<p>-Women’s <a href=""https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/sleep-drive-and-your-body-clock"">circadian cycle</a> is 6 minutes shorter than men’s on average</p>
<p>-Because of their shorter circadian cycles, women typically go to bed and wake up earlier</p>
<h1>Men</h1>
<p>-About 8% of men report having troubles sleeping</p>
<p>-More men suffer from sleep apnea than women</p>
<p>-Men report higher sleep satisfaction</p>
<p>Believe it or not, men and women even dream differently. Men dream more often than women. Dreams occur during REM sleep, and women who ovulate often have trouble sleeping. <a href=""http://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/a3389368/ways-men-and-women-sleep-differently/"">Since women experience less REM sleep, they experience less dreams. </a></p>

How Temperature Affects Your Sleep,168949635,"<p>From politics to the crazy things that come out of our grandparents’ mouths, there are many things we wish we could control in</p>
<p>life. While there are a number of uncontrollable factors that affect sleep, luckily one of the most important ones is something we  can control: temperature.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Temperature</h2>
<p>Keep it cool. For a restful, uninterrupted sleep, your body should be anywhere from<a href=""http://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/health/advice/a2364/how-temperature-affects-your-sleep/""> 65-72 degrees Fahrenheit. </a> If your body heats up too much during the night, you won’t be able to sleep well. Adjust the temperature in your bedroom to the cooler side, around 65 degrees Fahrenheit. The Eight Sleep App lets you monitor this; it tells you the temperature of your bed and bedroom so you can adjust it accordingly.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Sleepwear</h2>
<p>Ditch the sleepy time socks since they increase body temperature to uncomfortable degrees. During the summer, the less clothes you wear, the better. If you’re not one to embrace the birthday suit, wear thin, cotton pajamas, preferably shorts and a tank top.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Mattress</h2>
<p>If you’re a notorious bed sweater, it might not be your fault! Your bed could be the problem. Consider investing in a mattress that will help you stay cool at night. <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">Eight’s innovative smart bed</a> is designed to keep you cool. The reactive top layer of foam allows for optimal airflow and breathability, while the Active Grid dynamically cools to as low as 55 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Pillow and Sheets</h2>
<p>Investing in thin, breathable cotton sheets will allow you to sleep through the night without sweating.  If you find you’re sleeping warm, your pillow could also be a culprit. Some memory foam pillows tend to trap heat, so consider investing in a more breathable one.</p>
<p>Staying cool will help you get your best slumber yet.</p>",,5/11/2017 11:58,how-temperature-affects-your-sleep,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/AdobeStock_34069853.jpeg?v=1494518302,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
The Pros And Cons Of Napping,168948227,"<p>Naps are typically associated with young children, the elderly, and cats, but naps can be beneficial for people of all ages.  Read below to understand the positives and negatives of naps.</p>
<p>The recommended time for a nap is about 15-35 minutes. If a nap is within this time frame, there are numerable benefits. </p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>According to <a href=""https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/napping"">The Sleep Foundation</a>,</p>
<p>- Naps can restore alertness</p>
<p>- Naps can enhance performance</p>
<p>- Mistakes and accidents are reduced when people nap</p>
<p>- Naps can relax you</p>
<p>- Naps can give you more energy</p>
<ul></ul>
<ul></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/napping/page/0/1"">“A study at NASA on sleepy military pilots and astronauts found that a 40-minute nap improved performance by 34% and alertness 100%.”</a></p>
<p>However, many people can’t sleep during the day or aren’t comfortable sleeping somewhere other than their own beds. Naps are certainly not ideal for everyone, and there are some downfalls to the afternoon nap.</p>
<h2>Drawbacks</h2>
<p>- Naps can lead to grogginess  when you wake from a deep stage of sleep.  For people who take longer naps, they can become more disoriented for longer periods.</p>
<p>- Napping for too long can make it harder to sleep at night</p>
<p>- When you nap late in the day, it could make it harder to fall and stay asleep at night</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Overall, there are more benefits to napping. So next time you see Mittens napping in the afternoon sun, save the jealously and consider taking a cat nap yourself!</p>",,5/11/2017 11:32,the-pros-and-cons-of-napping,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/AdobeStock_54646673.jpeg?v=1494516725,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
The History Behind Memorial Day Mattress Sales,168826755,"<p>Memorial Day is an American holiday that honors fallen soldiers, so why has it become ubiquitous with mattress sales? Well, it doesn't take much to turn a national holiday into a consumer holiday. Although most people have the day off, retailers stay open. Everyday is a potential sale for a retail company, and holidays present the greatest opportunity for profit and growth. A <a href=""https://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/Infographic%3A+What+Will+Consumers+Be+Buying+This+Memorial+Day+Weekend%3F/10580018.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Goodshop</a> survey found that 53% of consumers who plan to shop on Memorial Day will be looking for sales, both online and in-store. Because over half of Americans are looking to shop, it makes sense that a Memorial Day sale will be a boon for business. </p>
<p>Long weekend holidays like Memorial Day, President's Day, and Labor Day have historically been the best for high-ticket items like mattresses. Most mattresses range from $800-$1200. This kind of pricey purchase is not an impulse buy. A three-day weekend allows consumers to think before they buy.  A mattress is a product that people interact with every day - it's an important part of life! Before e-commerce became big, people would use their three-day weekend to go to a mattress store and shop. Having this extra day gave someone and their significant other a chance to check out the mattress together. Now that online mattress companies like Eight exist, you can skip the store and <a href=""eightsleep.com"">buy online</a>. This will give you ample time to enjoy the barbecues and the beach. </p>
<p>Another reason why Memorial Day is such a big weekend for mattress sales is because Memorial Day is the unofficial start of summer. School is out and the sun is out. The warmer weather signals rest and relaxation. People tend to view the summer as vacation. They believe they have more time to sleep, hence why everyone is thinking about mattresses at the end of May. </p>
<p>Summer is also a primetime for moving. According to real estate figures, most Americans move between May and September. Nobody wants to move when it's cold out, and the nicer weather makes lugging boxes back and fourth easier and more enjoyable. People also move more in the summer due to summer internships and new jobs after graduation. Recent college grads will be moving out of their home and looking to furnish their new apartment. In addition, many newlyweds will be moving into a new home together during the summer months because summer season is wedding season. When a person relocates, they usually buy new furniture. Don't worry about struggling to fit your huge mattress through your door! Get one <a href=""eightsleep.com"">shipped in a box</a> from Eight. </p>
<p>Lastly, May marks a rise of consumer spending. According to a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/07/14/americans-are-spending-more-money-this-summer-but-not-on-fun-stuff/?utm_term=.9a0f6f387e8f"">Gallup survey</a>, Americans start spending more money in the summer. The average dollar amount continues to increase until the winter holidays. Then there is a significant drop off after January. Perhaps it is the Memorial Day Weekend sales that spark these spending trends. In fact, most sales actually begin a few weeks before the holiday. This Memorial Day, you can get <strong>$150 off any mattress at Eight</strong>, free shipping and returns! </p>",,5/9/2017 11:43,the-history-behind-memorial-day-mattress-sales,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/memorial-day-sales.jpg?v=1494344596,,open,open,Uncategorized,"Product, Trending"
Are Teachers Getting Enough Sleep?,168825987,"<p>In honor of National Teacher Appreciation Week, we decided to examine how being a teacher can affect sleep. </p>
<p>A <a href=""http://cms.bsu.edu/news/articles/2008/9/study-finds-that-teachers-are-fighting-to-stay-awake-in-the-classroom"">study</a> by Ball State University found that 43% of teachers slept 6 hours or less a night, and 64% reported feeling drowsy during school hours. The study is from 2008, and with all the new curriculum requirements added in many schools since then, sleep deprivation could be worse by now.  Our educators teach us many valuable lessons, but are they learning how to properly sleep?</p>
<p>The majority of teachers don’t stop working at the end of the school day.  Classes may end at 3pm, but teachers work well into the night.  They must attend after school meetings, plan lessons, and grade papers, not to mention deal with their own personal lives and obligations. These responsibilities are nearly constant, and it’s no wonder many teachers don’t have time to sleep the recommended eight hours at night.</p>
<p>Besides staying up late, many teachers also wake up before the sun in order to get to work on time.  </p>
<p>Teachers work hard for their students, but the fact is a tired teacher is not a great teacher. People are more likely to make mistakes when they are sleep deprived. Teachers getting more rest will not only benefit their students, but it is important for their own health as well. According to <a href=""http://www.healthline.com/health/sleep-deprivation/effects-on-body"">Healthline</a>, “Sleep deprivation can lead to [a] higher risk of chronic health problems like high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.”</p>
<p>Dealing with a room full of kids is a hard enough task when you’re well rested, so don’t let a lack of sleep make it even more exhausting.</p>

<p><a href=""https://giphy.com/gifs/ferris-buellers-day-off-bueller-sW6P26sp3HFvy"">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>While the amount of work will likely not dwindle, there are steps you can take as a teacher to sleep better. It can be tempting to drink that coffee at night to help you focus on grading, but <strong>avoid caffeine</strong> before bed as it disrupts sleep. Another trick? <strong>Stick to a regular sleep schedule.</strong> You make your students follow a class schedule, so lead by example. It can be daunting thinking of all the young futures you're shaping, so to avoid worrying keeping you up at night, <strong>try a warm bath</strong> before bed to relax. If you don't already do so, <strong>staying organized</strong> with a weekly planner can help manage your workload so it doesn't keep you up as much at night. </p>

How Eight’s App Compares to Other Sleep Apps,168825859,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s not a surprise that many people want to learn about their sleep and rely on sleep apps to help. What is surprising? Most of these apps are pretty useless and don’t actually teach users much about sleep at all.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A new</span><a href=""https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-04/uoia-sos041217.php""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> conducted by the University of Illinois analyzed 35 popular sleep apps and found that the majority of them are not helpful to users. Most apps fail to provide people with key information about the importance of sleep and the factors that negatively affect it. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to </span><a href=""https://journal.thriveglobal.com/where-all-those-sleep-apps-fall-short-6c3952d75595""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thrive Global</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, “Fewer than 15 percent of the apps provided any information about how sleep and sleep deprivation affect our health.” If people are not informed of the importance of sleep, they will not be motivated to change their sleeping patterns. What’s more, they may not know how to. Think about it, what’s the point of knowing the hours you slept if you don’t know the correct amount of hours you actually need and how to achieve that?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleeping apps are only useful when they teach users </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">how </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">to change their sleeping patterns. Unlike the majority of sleep Apps, Eight’s sleep app, which pairs with the Eight </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/eight-sleep-tracker""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleep Tracker,</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> can actually help you improve your sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There is a Sleep Lab section on the Eight app where you can perform a sleep experiment for a week. Eight analyzes data to tell you how many hours of sleep you need in order to be properly rested. The results of this experiment become your sleep score goal, the score you aim for every night.</span></p>
<p><img src=""//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/products/App_-_Last_Night_Data_1_4122e0b3-4deb-4c6d-a21e-b98e7ca501f1_large.png?v=1489597927"" alt="""" width=""351"" height=""321"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""></p>
<p>The Eight app is personalized to you. By comparing factors, like exercise and temperature, to your nightly sleep data, you’ll know what affects your sleep most and how to sleep optimally.

"Mothers Experience More Sleep Challenges Than Fathers, According To Our New Study",168774019,"<p>Sleep deprivation is an inevitable part of having children, and it has long been assumed that mothers carry the brunt of this exhaustion. From cradling her baby boy to sleep to lying awake worrying about her teenage son's whereabouts, mothers definitely lose sleep over their children. With this hypothesis in mind, we set out to find out what being a mother actually does to your sleep. We conducted a survey paired with true sleep data analysis in order to prove whether parenthood affects sleep or not, and if it does to what extent. </p>
<p>Our analysis found that on average, moms are faced with the most sleep challenges including more frequent interruptions and trouble falling asleep. In addition, <strong>only 13% of women with children rate their sleep as good, compared to 46% of fathers. </strong></p>
<p>Parents ages 25 and up living in the U.S. were surveyed about their sleep habits and patterns, and were asked to rate the quality of their sleep. We analyzed these responses in correlation to the sleep data collected from our Sleep Tracker and Smart Mattress, which measures over 12 sleep data points including sleep times, toss and turns, and deep and light sleep. </p>
<p>Although the data showed that women sleep more than men, mothers experience greater sleep challenges. Moms frequently reported having trouble falling asleep, with 10% saying they have trouble ""always"" and 16% ""often"" - compared to 7% and 12% respectively for dads. Women with children also report getting up in the middle of the night more often than men with children. In families where children wake up in the night, mothers' sleep suffers more than that of dads' with their amount of deep sleep decreasing considerably. A healthy person's deep sleep range per night is 18 to 25%. Moms with children who wake up twice per night present a lower average than dads in the same situation: 21% vs 24%. </p>
<p>Mothers may sleep longer (7 hours 34 minutes compared to 7 hours 17 minutes for fathers), but that doesn't mean they are getting a good night's sleep. The old saying quality over quantity rings true. A mom whose sleep is disrupted during the night may not get enough full cycles of sleep. This explains why she is less likely to rate her sleep as ""good."" She probably feels more tired during the day due to the frequent wake-ups and the difficulty falling asleep. </p>
<p>Help your mom get the best sleep possible this Mother's Day. Don't do something to worry her and make sure she is as comfortable and relaxed as possible. Treat her to a spa day, she deserves it! </p>
