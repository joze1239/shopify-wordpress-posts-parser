How Meditation Can Improve Sleep,383748145240,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Meditation is a long-honored practice of breathing deeply and quieting the mind. Meditation for sleep can be done through mindfulness visualizations, guided prompts, or simply by sitting comfortably free of distractions. It’s a practice used by many to alleviate stress, calm anxiety, and improve the quality of sleep. Since it’s a quiet activity meant to relax both the mind and body, it’s the perfect way to prepare for a good night’s sleep.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By limiting the level of stimulation in the brain and centering the mind on one calming mantra or intention, it allows the mind to slow down and drift off to sleep more easily. For those who have difficulty battling insomnia, practicing meditation is one method that may be helpful. It’s accessible to anyone and doesn’t require a lot of time to have a big impact in decreasing sleep problems.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To begin, sit comfortably with your legs crossed and palms up in a room free of noise and distraction. Start to slow your breath and pay attention to your inhales and exhales. Many like to use the three-second breathing method: Inhale for three seconds, hold it for three seconds, and exhale for three seconds. Continue this rhythm until it becomes natural and you can continue the breathing exercises without counting. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As you practice meditation, close your eyes and allow your thoughts to flow through freely. Rather than clearing the mind completely, avoid holding onto any single thought. Another option is to follow a sound or guided meditation on sleep available through various apps. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Meditation and sleep best practices help to relieve stress, calm your mind, and allow you to truly tune into what your mind and body needs. Taking a few moments every night can put you in a peaceful state of mind and let your body know that it’s time to relax.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Incorporating Meditation Into a Healthy Sleep Routine</span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleep deprivation occurs for several reasons: lifestyle changes, insomnia, sleep apnea, illness, and a range of other challenges. The effects of sleep deprivation on the brain make it difficult for many to achieve a solid eight hours of sleep per night. Social media and smartphones also affect how much sleep we get each night. Whether it’s the alert of notifications, the screen’s glow, or anticipation and anxiety that continues to stimulate the mind even after we look away from the screen, it makes it harder to wind down and achieve good sleep. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To help remedy sleep deprivation, it’s important to find a sleep routine that works for you. Meditation is a valuable addition to any healthy sleep habits. Other ways to fall asleep faster include: </span></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Exercising in the evening</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Avoiding late afternoon naps</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lowering the temperature in your bedroom </span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Limiting the amount of caffeine consumed throughout the day</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Removing electronics from the room </span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Being mindful of what you eat before bed</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Getting a new pillow or mattress</span></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Each of these tips promote a healthier sleep routine that when followed can help you get quality, consistent sleep. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Exercising in the Evening</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Maintaining a regular exercise routine is beneficial to your health and some find it more effective in the evening as a way to wind down. By engaging in physical activity a few hours before your regular bedtime, it raises your body temperature, much like a warm bath or shower might do. Afterward, you get to experience the cooldown period, which prepares you for better sleep. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s not recommended to participate in high-intensity exercise right before bed, but a long walk, lifting weights, or yoga are all good ways to workout without overstimulating the body and mind too much. Each of these restorative activities pair nicely with meditation for sleep and can be performed at the same time.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Avoiding Late Afternoon Naps</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Depending on your typical sleep cycle, naps may be a trick to get you on a regular sleep routine. However, be wary of taking naps too late in the day for too long. This can throw off your body’s natural rhythm and keep you awake far past your normal bedtime. Exactly how long should you nap for? If it helps to rest during the day, set a timer for 20 or 30 minutes to take a quick nap. Even if you're unable to fully achieve falling asleep, it’s also a good time to meditate for a few moments and be still.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some people may need extra time to feel refreshed, while others feel groggy if they nap for too long. Listen to your body and sleep when necessary during the day. If you find yourself sleeping long stretches during the day but inconsistently at night, it’s likely that your circadian rhythm is off and needs to be recalibrated.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lowering the Temperature in Your Bedroom</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the most common reasons people have difficulty falling or staying asleep is because their room is too warm. When the thermostat isn’t at your ideal sleeping temperature, it can be difficult to doze off or meditate. When the temperature is at one end of the extremes, your body won’t be able to fully relax. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Turn down the thermostat a few degrees. If you don’t have the air-conditioning system on, open the windows or run a fan to prompt air circulation throughout the room and provide enough ventilation. During the winter, still keep the thermostat set lower and layer your bedding rather than having one heavy blanket to cover the bed. With the </span><a href=""https://www.eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight Sleep Pod</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, you will have the ability to personalize your bed temperature to regulate the perfect temperature. Simple changes like these can do wonders for how much and how well you sleep at night.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Limiting the Amount of Caffeine Throughout the Day</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Everyone responds to caffeine consumption differently. Some can make it through the day with one cup of coffee in the morning, while others stock up on caffeinated drinks all day long. If you’re used to drinking a high amount of caffeine, slowly reduce the amount you consume every day. Or, strive for a “cutoff” point and see if it affects your sleep for the better.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For example, an afternoon coffee or tea might be manageable, if it’s not after 3 PM. Test different times and amounts of caffeine to determine the right amount for you. A better option is to swap your daily pick-me-up with a walk around the block, stretching, or added hydration. You may be surprised how well these work in place of your favorite caffeinated beverages.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Removing Electronics from the Room </span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the digital age, we look at our smartphones multiple times a day. It’s not uncommon to also read articles, scroll through social media, or watch videos all the way up to when it’s time for bed. While it can feel restful in the moment, the constant online activity and light from the screen can trigger the brain to stay alert and awake. As a result, it takes longer to settle into sleep. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Try limiting how much you look at screens in the evening. When finished using, power them down and leave them in another room at least an hour before bed. Take advantage of any additional time to read a book or magazine, meditate, or another quiet activity that doesn’t require interaction or too much engagement.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Being Mindful of What You Eat Before Bed</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Spicy or acidic foods are known to disrupt sleep because of the effects they have on the body, especially when eaten late in the evening. These types of foods can cause an upset stomach, acid reflux, or heartburn, all of which can cause discomfort and keep you up at night. When these symptoms become a reason you can’t sleep, cut back on what you eat right before bed. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Milder foods like bananas or oatmeal are the kinds of snacks that can help cure the midnight munchies and also, promote fitful sleep. You can also reference 10 foods to eat before bed to help you sleep better. When you focus your attention to what’s triggering certain events or limitations to your sleep, you can start changing your dietary and other lifestyle habits for the better.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Getting a New Pillow or Mattress</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re not sleeping well and nothing else seems to be working, it may be as simple as swapping out your pillow or mattress. Waking up with a stiff neck is never fun and can be a result of a pillow that’s lost its fluff. Also, if your pillow isn’t in good condition, you may end up tossing and turning throughout the night. The same goes for the support of your mattress.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Do a pillow test and find what level of firmness you like best and switch out the old with something new. Typically, you should buy new pillows every one to two years and a new mattress every ten. By updating your bedding, it provides a comfortable place to rest without shifting sleeping positions all night to find the one that works well. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Being Mindful about Sleep</span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Meditation before sleep benefits include being present in the moment and checking in with how you feel physically and mentally. By creating a healthy sleep routine, you are proactively changing your environment and habits to get better sleep. It doesn’t require adding every method into your own sleep routine. Pick and choose the parts that work best for you and leave the rest.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whenever your mind starts to wander and you just can’t fall asleep, meditation helps as a tool to get you back to a relaxed state. Once you’ve developed healthy sleep habits, including meditation, your sleep should soon begin to improve.  </span></p>",,1/8/2020 17:25,how-meditation-can-improve-sleep,eightguestwriter,Eight Collaborator,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/meditation-1600x1200.jpg?v=1578522352,,open,open,Uncategorized,
Effects of Working Out Before Sleep,383748046936,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Regular exercise works hand-in-hand with getting a good night’s sleep as ways to maintain optimal health. The question has always been is it better to work out in the morning or at night? There are several advantages to working out before sleep, but every person is different. Try different times of day to find what works best for you. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Also, take into account: what are your sleep habits?</span><a href=""https://site.eightsleep.com/blogs/news/are-you-a-hot-sleeper""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Are you a hot sleeper</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">? See if that’s what’s keeping you up at night or if it’s the exercise itself. Benefits of working out before sleep include: </span></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Raises body temperature followed by a post-workout cooldown phase</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Alleviates stress and tension</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Establishes a routine that promotes consistency for your circadian rhythm</span></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Establish what your current sleep patterns are and how working out may improve how well you sleep. Reference our article, What is a Normal Sleeping Pattern for further information. Each of these benefits can lead to a consistent sleep schedule and more quality rest per night. By exploring each benefit more fully, you’ll determine what’s likely to be a successful first step for you. </span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;""></span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Raises Body Temperature</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Working out increases the heart rate, gets the blood pumping, and raises your body temperature. While this may not sound ideal for a good night’s rest, by giving yourself enough time between working and going to sleep, it heats up the body (similar to a warm bath or shower) and then, rewards your workout with a cool down period. Your body temperature weighs heavily on how well you’ll sleep through the night. It naturally lowers when it’s time to sleep. To ensure you’re sleeping at your optimal sleeping temperature, smart beds like the </span><a href=""https://www.eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight Sleep Pod</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> can regulate your bed to your </span><a href=""https://site.eightsleep.com/blogs/news/ideal-bed-temperature""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ideal sleeping temperature.</span></a></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The idea of “working out, can’t sleep” isn’t necessarily true. There are studies that show working out before bed doesn’t alter the amount or quality of your sleep. However, vigorous activity right before bed may keep you alert for longer. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Plan your workouts accordingly. Avoid working out a few hours before your regular bedtime to give the body enough time to adjust and transition from activity to a resting state. This could mean a high-intensity workout in the morning and a gentle yoga practice or an after-dinner walk in the evening. </span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;""></span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Alleviates Stress and Tension</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another positive effect of working out is how it alleviates stress. This is especially helpful before going to sleep if you’re challenged by quieting the mind or feeling antsy as you try to drift off to sleep. Exercise helps to reduce tension and puts you in a relaxed state of being and promotes sleep. Additionally, a post-workout stretch or time spent in a steam room or jacuzzi following a workout can alleviate muscle soreness and provide an overall sense of relaxation the body needs to prepare for sleep.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For many, a workout in the evening is a relaxing transition from the hectic pace of work and commuting to a time where you get to focus on yourself. Exercising for your health isn’t a new concept. Although, studies still find most Americans spend more time participating in sedentary activities like going online or watching TV rather than allotting 20 or 30 minutes for exercise. In fact, some even skip workouts due to stress rather than a way to combat it. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Adding in regular workouts throughout the week is one of the most effective stress management techniques people can try, which in turn, helps to maintain consistent sleep patterns.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;""></span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Establishes a Routine</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Improving sleep habits comes down to finding a routine that works for you. Consistency balances your circadian rhythm and gives you body signals of when it’s time to slow down and rest and when it’s time to be awake and focus. Adding a workout in the evening helps to establish this healthy habit. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To avoid getting burnout, mix up your workouts and establish goals. For example, dealing with a hectic work schedule may mean consistency for you is a 20-minute workout each evening with a mix of high- and low-level intensity exercises. Taking that time each day for yourself gets your mind and body on daily cycle of activity and makes it easier once bedtime rolls around to go to sleep.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Starting with 20 minutes may be too much. Reduce it to 10 and keep the pace low. Stretching, yoga, or other gentle exercises may be just as beneficial if you make it routine. Keep in mind that what works for others may not work for you. A full cardio workout may be well-suited for the morning or during the day. Too much stimulation may keep you awake past your regular bedtime. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’ve tried multiple ways of working out in the evening and you feel it’s keeping you up at night, simply switch your schedule. For many, exercise has been known to help create regular sleep patterns, but only you can decide how much it’s helping you.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;""></span></h2>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How Exercise Benefits Sleep in Other Ways</span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In addition to regulating body temperature, alleviating stress, and helping to establish a routine, regular exercise helps in other ways, which ultimately leads to better sleep. First, it promotes a healthier immune system. The less you fall ill, the more sleep you’re able to get. Whenever cold season rolls around, nighttime coughs, sneezing, and other aches and pains keep people up for hours and make it uncomfortable for them to go to sleep. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By exercising as a means of preventative care, it can lead to less time being sick or less extreme cases. A bad cold or the flu will throw off even the most stringent of sleep schedules. Avoiding illness as much as possible is key. The long-held remedy of getting plenty of rest and drinking fluids holds true today.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In addition to aiding with temporary illness, regular exercise reduces chronic pain and inflammation as well. Matching the exercise to your health or skill level is important to give your body what it needs. Do you regularly suffer from stiff joints and muscles? The gentle stretching of yoga or swimming at a consistent but leisurely pace gives you a workout without adding extra strain on the body. Alternatively, cardio workouts are beneficial for heart health and may reduce the amount of bloating or inflammation in the body. To add an additional precaution, it may also be helpful to research on the best sleeping position for lower back pain. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Regular exercise along with a balanced diet also helps with weight management. Obesity often leads to certain sleep disorders like sleep apnea and insomnia. Essentially, sleep apnea causes you to stop and start breathing throughout the night and snore, both of which are sleep disruptors. These types of conditions means you’re not receiving regular sleep throughout the night and have to fight fatigue during the day. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s also important to keep in mind that increasing your level of activity affects your metabolism and make you hungrier than before. It’s best to refrain from eating several hours before bed to avoid acid reflux or heartburn, which affects sleep patterns. The body needs enough time to digest before entering a sleep phase, so it’s best to avoid late night eating. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When hunger strikes, choose your late-night snacks wisely. Foods like bananas, oatmeal, and cottage cheese are beneficial. They contain tryptophan, an amino acid used to create serotonin to relax the body and prepare it for sleep. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After you’ve reached a place of good, consistent sleep, you’ll notice how much it improves other areas of health. Sometimes people pay attention to their diet and exercise without giving much thought to how well they’re sleeping at night. The benefits of quality sleep work in tandem with other daily habits and make just as much of a difference in a person’s overall health. </span></p>
<p> </p>

<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;""></span></h2>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Finding What Works for You</span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Exercise in the evening is one of many ways to improve your sleep routine. However, it differs from person to person. For some, it tires the body out and allows it to relax, while others feel too stimulated after they’ve exercised to have it do any good. If you prefer to keep your workouts to daylight hours, another way to establish a beneficial bedtime routine is by keeping track of what’s keeping you up at night. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By recording your sleep habits, determining what is a normal sleeping pattern, and rating your sleep level, you’ll be able to identify what may be holding you back from better sleep. For example, are you waking up frequently throughout the night? If so, check the temperature in the room. A room that’s too hot or too cold will keep you up at night and prevent you from experiencing deep sleep. Is it difficult to find a comfortable position when sleeping? Evaluate the condition of your pillow, mattress, and bedding. You may need to replace them with something new. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are several factors that play a part in how well we sleep. The point of finding a routine that is customized to you is understanding which of these factors provide you with your most optimal sleep and what detractors make you skimp. Eliminate the negative conditions and habits as much as possible and adapt to what promotes healthy sleep by creating positive habits. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lower the temperature in your room. Leave the electronics off in the hours leading up to bed. Or, try working out before sleep. List everything that is beneficial and prioritize your sleep as a significant part of your health. </span></p>",,1/8/2020 17:04,effects-of-working-out-before-sleep,eightguestwriter,Eight Collaborator,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/workout-1600x1200.jpg?v=1578521085,,open,open,Uncategorized,

Introducing: the Eight Sleep Pod,28624617560,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We founded Eight Sleep four years ago, with the mission to leverage technology to improve sleep performance. Thanks to the thousands of customers who have joined us on this journey, we’ve collected more than 43 million hours of sleep data and learned a tremendous amount about what factors keep people up at night. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The biggest one is temperature. We know this from looking at our own data, existing research and also from talking to our customers, 78% of whom told us they wanted a product to give them full control over the temperature in their bed. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That’s why I’m so excited to announce our most cutting-edge product yet: the Pod, the first bed with dynamic cooling and heating that keeps you at the perfect temperature all night long. The result is that you never feel too hot or cold at night, reducing sleep interruptions and increasing periods of deep sleep.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Pod uses temperature also to wake you up naturally before your alarm goes off. By gradually cooling the bed, the thermo alarm enhances the natural body temperature change prior to wake up so that you feel refreshed as you get out of bed. The Pod also has numerous other features, like biometric tracking, sleep coaching and smart home integrations, meant to round out its offering as an all-in-one platform for better sleep. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Humanity deserves to get more out of its time asleep, and the Pod brings us one step closer to delivering that.</span></p>",,2/13/2019 7:59,introducing-the-eight-sleep-pod,eightmatteofranceschetti,Matteo Franceschetti,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/phone_bed_3.jpg?v=1550062794,,open,open,Uncategorized,Product
Ideal Bed Temperature,28616032344,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You probably know by now just how much the temperature of your room can impact your sleep, for better or for worse. What you might not know is that the temperature of your actual bed can make just as much of a difference for your sleep.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bed temperature may be a major factor standing between you and a good night’s rest. Mattresses without proper airflow trap heat, leading to a night of tossing and turning. If the temperature of your bed has you sleeping too hot or sleeping too cool, it may be time to purchase a new mattress or bed topper.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But what is the ideal bed temperature? Like many other aspects of sleep, it’s different for everyone. If you’re constantly waking up sweating or freezing, your mattress composition might be to blame. Typically, more people report sleeping hot than sleeping cold. Mattresses, specifically memory foam beds, can cause people to sleep hot because the foam the beds are made of doesn’t contain enough air pockets. Even some foam mattresses with cooling gel can trap heat.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It's important to remember that your bed is also a part of your bedroom environment. Most research suggests the temperature in your bedroom should be around </span><a href=""https://site.eightsleep.com/blogs/news/should-you-really-sleep-at-68-degrees""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">68 degrees</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, depending on your age. Therefore, the temperature of your bed should be similar to what room temperature you sleep best at. The ideal bed temperature is </span><a href=""https://thethirty.byrdie.com/best-temperature-for-sleep""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">from 60-68 degrees </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and will change slightly as you age. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A majority of people report sleeping hot rather than cold, although there are certainly plenty of people who sleep cool. Waterbeds and innerspring beds without padding, for example, tend to cause people to sleep cool because there’s too much airflow.  Simply placing a memory foam topper or a heating pad on your mattress can help with your bed temperature regulation.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So how do you control bed temperature? A </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">bed like the <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Eight Sleep Pod</a></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is an even better option because it allows you to regulate the temperature, both cooling and heating to keep you comfortable. Your bed can be temperature controlled with the Eight Sleep app or setup automatically based on your sleep patterns. When used in conjunction with a variety of smart devices, you can have total bedroom temperature control. Body temperature changes throughout the night, so a mattress that can heat up and cool down as the body goes through different sleep cycles will lead to a better night's rest, guaranteed.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Pod makes finding your ideal bed temperature easy. You can view your sleep data on the Eight Sleep app and see how your sleep changes as your body temperature changes throughout the night. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With bed temperature control, a better night’s sleep is in the forecast.</span></p>

How to Get More Deep Sleep,28615966808,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All sleep isn’t the same. REM, or rapid eye movement, is an important sleep stage. But the right amount of stage 3 of NREM sleep, also known as deep sleep, is crucial to a good night’s sleep and your overall health. Deep sleep helps to restore both your body and your brain. Feeling rested is impossible without the proper amount of deep sleep. So how exactly do you get more hours of deep sleep?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Track sleep</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The best way to start is to understand how much deep sleep you’re already getting. The Eight Sleep </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pod</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> has built in piezo sensors that compile and analyze your sleep data nightly. You can view a full sleep report on the app and see how much deep sleep you’re averaging per night. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Relax</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Taking time to unwind before bed keeps you from staying awake late into the night thinking about daily life stressors. Whether through meditation, journaling or a number of other relaxation methods, it’s important to take time to calm your brain and body before bed.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>No bright lights</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You probably know by now that screen time before bed isn’t good for sleep. But those late night Netflix binges prevent you from getting better sleep more than you may realize. The blue light emitted from screens throws off your body’s internal clock, or circadian rhythm. Your brain is tricked into believing it’s not nighttime because of the light, making it harder to fall asleep and get enough deep sleep.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Maintain a healthy diet</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Meals and drinks are easy to overlook when you think of getting more deep sleep. However, a healthy diet is key to a healthy sleep schedule. Avoid certain heavy foods like ice cream and pasta before bed. Caffeine should also be avoided at least two hours before you plan on going to bed. Besides caffeine, alcohol can also be detrimental to sleep. Cut out that nightcap when possible. Alcohol often makes you fall asleep easier, but it makes it harder for you to stay asleep throughout the night.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Keep bedtime consistent</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Maintaining a </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/how-to-keep-a-consistent-sleep-schedule""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sleep schedule</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is crucial to getting more deep sleep. Although it may be tempting to stay up later and sleep in on weekends, waking up and going to bed at roughly the same time every day can help you sleep better. Your circadian rhythm, gets thrown off when you go to sleep at vastly different times. In order to ensure your body stays in deep sleep for the right amount of time, keep your sleep schedule consistent.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Manage temperature</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you struggle with waking up too hot or cold during the night, you’re not alone! Temperature is one of the biggest issues affecting sleep quality, leading to frequent interruptions and thus reducing periods of deep sleep. The </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pod</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> learns your temperature preferences and then adjusts the thermal environment on either side of the bed automatically, so you can fall asleep faster and stay in deep sleep without disturbance. </span></p>

Menopause and Sleep,28615934040,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Menopause and sleep tend to go together as well as oil and water.  Hot flashes are difficult enough to suffer through during the day, let alone at night as well. Luckily, there are certain actions you can take to try and improve your sleep while avoiding too much sweat.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>The Science</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hot flashes are one of the most common aspects of menopause. They occur in about </span><a href=""https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322351.php""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">85% of women </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">in the U.S. experiencing perimenopause and menopause. The changes in levels of estrogen and progesterone in a woman’s body lead to these uncomfortable hot flashes and night sweats. </span><a href=""https://www.thesleepdoctor.com/2018/01/05/menopause-affects-sleep/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Estrogen also helps the body use serotonin</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that lead to sound sleep. When estrogen levels drop, there’s a rise in disrupted sleep. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As if hot flashes weren't frustrating enough, increased insomnia is also reported in women during peri to post menopause. </span><a href=""https://www.everydayhealth.com/menopause-pictures/tips-to-sleep-better-with-menopause.aspx#02""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">61% of women</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> experience insomnia during menopause. Without proper sleep, you’re more likely to feel irritable and less likely to function as well as you normally would during the day. It’s important to make sure your body gets all the sleep it needs as it experiences major changes. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>The Solutions</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While the ideal room temperature for sleep differs for everyone, it is generally around <a href=""https://site.eightsleep.com/blogs/news/should-you-really-sleep-at-68-degrees"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">68 degrees</a>. Turn the temperature in your bedroom down a few degrees cooler than what you’d normally set it at when you aren’t experiencing night sweats. This way, you’ll be less likely to wake up during the night when experiencing hot flashes. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleeping during hot flashes can also be improved by sleeping on a mattress with proper airflow that doesn’t trap body heat. A </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">cooling mattress like the Pod</a> </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is the perfect option for regulating temperature so you can sleep better while having hot flashes. The Pod features dynamic temperature regulation, cooling down up to 55 degrees Fahrenheit to keep you comfortable in those hot sweaty nights.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">The Pod</a> allows you to change the temperature on each side of the bed whenever you feel too hot. You can even set your bed temperature to naturally lower at certain times throughout the night.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Using a comfortable cooling pillow also helps to ensure you don’t wake up in a pool of sweat. </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/the-cool-pillow?variant=12289047887960""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Adjustable cool pillows</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> are ideal since you can remove and add layers so you always get the right support.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Trying different solutions like the ones mentioned above and keeping track of the results can be overwhelming. However, a </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/eight-sleep-tracker?variant=34186577923""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sleep tracker</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> helps you to track how well you slept when using a certain sleep technique. Sleep trackers allow you to see how and when your body temperature changed so you can sleep better during menopause.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While body changes are inevitable in women, sleeping during menopause doesn’t have to feel impossible. Talk to your doctor or consult a sleep specialist if typical fixes for hot flashes while sleeping aren’t effective for you. </span></p>",,2/10/2019 22:46,menopause-and-sleep,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/menopause_definition.jpeg?v=1549856782,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
The Secrets of Cool Sleeping,11332354136,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It seems that there are many nights we wake up covered in sweat. It is a fairly common issue, and while there are several possible causes for sweating at night, most obviously warm weather, we may not always know how to actually fix the issue. Learning how to sleep without sweating doesn’t have to be a big mystery. Check out these five useful secrets to help you sleep cool every night.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Cool down before bed</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your habits before bed significantly affect how you sleep during the night. If you already refrain from exercising at night but still sleep hot, there's another trick to try. Rubbing some ice or cold water on pressure points such as your wrists and temples helps to lower your body temperature. This way, you can fall asleep and sleep cool.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Wear your birthday suit</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Maybe the most exhilarating but obvious secret to sleeping cool is to sleep naked. Clothes trap in heat and moisture, making you sleep hot. Ditching your pajamas in lieu of nothing is not only freeing, but it’s a fast way to a cool sleep. If you prefer to wear clothes to bed, just make sure to opt for breathable fabrics like organic 100% cotton. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Take it downstairs</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You probably know that heat rises, but it is easy to forget this simple, 3rd grade science fact when hot nights roll in. A big secret to sleeping cool is to sleep in the lowest possible area of your house. When the temperature rises, your mattress should lower. While it’s not feasible for everyone to bring a mattress downstairs during hot nights (specifically those of us who live in apartments), you can still sleep on a downstairs couch or even physically lower your bed frame if possible. Bear in mind that north facing rooms also tend to have a lower temperature. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Zip it, lock it, put it in the freezer</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A simple but clever trick to help you avoid sleeping hot is to freeze your fabrics. It may sound unconventional, but it works well. Take your bedsheets, and even pajamas and pillowcase if you like, and put them in a sealed gallon bag. Afterwards, simply set them in the freezer for a few hours. Take the bag out about a half hour before you plan on going to sleep. Fabrics at the right temperature will feel cool to the touch, and your body will want to fall asleep right away. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Ditch the heat trapping bed</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The secret is out: your bed is likely the number one culprit of you sleeping hot. If you’ve tried other methods to no avail, it might be time to get a new, high quality mattress with improved airflow. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">cooling mattress like the Pod</a> is</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> a great option since it offers premium materials paired with a layer of technology that can cool down to 55 degrees Fahrenheit - and stay that cool all night! You’ll never be able to sleep if you have a hot bed or high room temperature, so try switching to a <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">cooler bed.</a></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleep well, not hot. </span></p>",,10/29/2018 14:24,the-secrets-of-cool-sleeping,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/man_drinking_water.jpeg?v=1549660517,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
What Are Night Sweats?,11332321368,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You may be looking forward to the start of cooler temperatures, but for many sleepers the arrival of fall and cooler weather doesn’t necessarily mean the end of their excessive sweating.  While occasional night sweat is not a cause for alarm, continually waking up from overheating can be both annoying and unhealthy. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What are night sweats?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Also known as nocturnal hyperhidrosis, night sweats are a fairly common condition present in certain men, women, and children.  Much like the name suggests, night sweats involve excessive sweating during the night, often resulting in pajamas and sheets drenched with sweat. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you repeatedly wake up to sheets wet from sweat with no outside cause, then you have experienced night sweats. It’s typical for people to wake up hot from external factors, but this isn't the same as actual night sweats. Waking up after an unusually hot summer night in a fan-less room or under five blankets covered in sweat doesn’t qualify as night sweats. Rather, night sweats are a physical condition that are not impacted by your sleep environment.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What causes night sweats?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Excessive sweating may seem worrisome, but night sweats can usually be explained quite easily. Night sweats may be a sign of an infection or medical condition. One of the most common reasons behind night sweats for women is menopause. There are also a variety of other less likely potential causes, such as low blood sugar and hormone disorders. Additionally, night sweats can also be an uncomfortable side effect of certain medications, particularly antidepressants.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Can you get rid of night sweats? </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Excessively sweating at night can be uncomfortable and embarrassing. Even worse, night sweats leave you feeling gross and prevent a good night’s rest. Once you’ve identified that there are no external factors (unbreathable fabrics, hot room temperature, hot bed etc.) that are causing your excessive sweating, talk to your doctor to figure out potential health related causes. </span></p>",,10/29/2018 14:22,what-are-night-sweats,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/woman_sweating_trying_to_sleep.jpeg?v=1541450383,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
Are You a Hot Sleeper?,11332288600,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It can be extremely challenging to get a good night’s rest as a hot sleeper. Tossing and turning all night due to body and temperature is frustrating. Luckily, there are solutions for sleeping hot that help to cool down both your body and your sleeping environment.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are people who naturally sleep hot aside from outside factors. However, it’s important to check that your room or bed isn't the main reason you get overheated in your sleep. Don't underestimate the role your mattress plays in helping you achieve good sleep. Always make sure that your mattress provides proper airflow and doesn’t trap body heat. Cheaply made memory foam mattresses, while comfy, often lack proper airflow.  Aside from replacing a poor quality mattress, you can adjust the temperature of your room until you find the perfect sleep temperature.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you still find that you sleep hot at night, there are a simple few tricks that can help cool your body down.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Sleep in cotton</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For many hot sleepers, pajamas can stick to sweaty skin and make them even more uncomfortable.  Always make sure to choose</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><span> </span>pajamas, underwear, pillow cases and </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/all-organic-sheets?variant=34044136067"">sheets </a>made of 100% cotton.

<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p><b>Switch to a cooler mattress</b></p>
<p><span mce-data-marked=""1"">It's well known that foam retains heat. With foam beds being oh so comfortable and oh so popular these days, your sleep is suffering. Try switching to a bed that merges comfort and active cooling, such as <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">the Pod</a>. It can cool down to 55 degrees Fahrenheit giving you the coolest most comfortable sleep all night, all year round.</span></p>

<p><b>Water and wind down</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re a hot sleeper, your bedtime rituals can make all the difference in helping you get a good night’s sleep. Take a cold washcloth or a few cubes of ice, and rub it on your pulse points before you turn in for the night. You should also keep a glass of ice next to the bed throughout the night as well. This way, if excessive sweating does wake you up, you can simply dab some water onto your forehead, temples, and wrists to cool you back down.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Shower</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The body naturally decreases in temperature before and during sleep. However, if you go to bed hot after an intense workout for example, it’s going to be harder for you to fall asleep due to your increased body temperature. Taking a shower may seem counterintuitive; why jump in hot water if I want to </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">lower </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">my body temperature? It isn’t the shower so much that helps your body to cool down but rather the temperature change from hot water to cool air when you step out. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Use a cooling pillow </strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are not very many people who haven't experienced waking up during the night feeling hot and flipping their pillow over to the cool side. However, you don't have to continuously flip over your pillow. By using a breathable <a href=""https://site.eightsleep.com/products/the-cool-pillow?variant=12289047887960"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">cooling pillow</a> that has natural cooling gel built in, both sides can be the cool sides. How cool is that?!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Enacting these easy sleep solutions to sleeping hot will help you to reach a temperature where you can easily fall, and more importantly,<em> stay</em> asleep.</span></p>

The Impact of Temperature on Sleep,11318853720,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Temperature plays a big factor in whether you get a good night’s rest or not. Even when we’re awake, sweating and freezing are uncomfortable. To ensure good sleep quality, channel Goldilocks and make sure the temperature of all aspects of your sleep environment, including your own internal temperature, are just right. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Brain Temperature</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">During NREM, non-rapid eye movement sleep, the temperature of both your brain and body falls. However, temperature rises during </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/the-difference-between-rem-and-deep-sleep""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">REM</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, rapid eye movement, sleep. It’s important to know how much time you spend in each cycle per night so you can adjust your bedroom temperature accordingly. Using a </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/eight-sleep-tracker?variant=34186577923""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sleep tracker</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is a helpful way to monitor your sleep cycles and body temperature changes nightly.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Body Temperature </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Temperature also plays a major role in </span><a href=""https://www.sleep.org/articles/keep-body-clock-on-track/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">circadian rhythm</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, often referred to as our body clock. Temperature tells the body and brain when to wake up and fall asleep. Our body temperature naturally lowers before sleep, so it’s important that external temperature factors like blankets and sheets don’t interfere with the body’s natural circadian cycle.  Taking a shower before bed can also help your body temperature decrease so you can fall and stay asleep. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As you sleep, your body temperature gradually changes. Body temperature rises slightly to help us wake up in the mornings. Cotton pajamas and </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/all-organic-sheets?variant=34044136067""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sheets</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> are not only comfortable, but they help to regulate your body's natural sleep temperature as well. Even better? Sleep naked if you find yourself waking up in a pool of sweat. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Bed Temperature</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even if your body temperature is properly regulated, your bed temperature can throw off your sleep. Certain materials in many memory foam mattresses can cause you to sleep hot. If your mattress doesn’t provide proper airflow, consider switching to a high quality </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"" mce-data-marked=""1"">cooling mattress such as <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">the Pod by Eight Sleep</a></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Bed temperature includes not only your mattress, but your pillows as well. The materials on your bed can cause you to sleep hot if they aren’t breathable, so always stick choose items with proper airflow. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Room Temperature </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">During REM sleep, the body temperature is determined by the temperature of your bedroom. So in order to get a good night’s, you have to regulate your room temperature. The easiest way to change the room temperature so it best suits your sleep needs is to adjust or turn off the AC, heat and/or fan. Bear in mind that leaving the blinds open during the day can cause your bedroom to be overly hot at night. If your room is causing you to sleep cool, move your bed away from the windows as far as you can. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Finding the right sleep temperature means taking the time to make sure the temperatures of your room, mattress and body are properly regulated. Once you ensure that your sleep temperature is right for you, you’ll find that falling and staying asleep doesn’t have to be a nightly challenge. </span></p>",,10/24/2018 14:43,the-impact-of-temperature-on-sleep,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/thermostat.jpeg?v=1541449577,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
Finding the Right Sleep Temperature,11295653976,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you wake up covered in sweat or shivering wrapped in your bed sheets, then your bedroom is definitely not the right temperature for sleep.  Finding the perfect sleep temperature can be tricky, but there are a couple thing to focus on to make it easier. While most people sleep best around 68 degrees, there is no one room temperature that is right for everyone. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Adjust room temperature</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For many sleepers, the ideal room temperature could be anywhere from 60-68 degrees. Finding out where you fall in that range may take some practice and adjustments, but eventually you’ll figure out what fan setting is right for you. No one wants to sleep hot, so simple things like keeping the blinds shut during the day can help you achieve your perfect sleep temperature. Keep in mind that the body naturally cools before sleep, so a cooler temperature generally helps you fall asleep quicker. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Check bed temperature </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your bed temperature may prevent you from falling and staying asleep at the perfect temperature. Try sleeping on your couch or an air mattress to determine if it’s your mattress that is causing you to sleep hot or cold. A hot bed is often a memory foam mattress that isn't designed to properly distribute air and moisture. Replacing your bed with a cooling bed such as <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">the Pod</a></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> may help you achieve the right sleep temperature.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Choose cotton </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your bed sheets, pillowcases, and bed sheets all factor into finding the right sleep temperature. Fabrics like silk and satin aren't breathable enough for you to sleep comfortably. Always choose 100% cotton when it comes to sheets and pajamas.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can also find your</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> own </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">perfect temperature for snoozing with some help from the </span><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eight-sleep/id1086913845?mt=8""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight app</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. The app helps you track changes in your sleep to see how they correspond with the temperature in your room and that of the bed itself. By being aware of such factors that affect sleep temperature, you’ll be able to find the ideal bed temperature for you in no time.</span></p>

What is the Right Sleep Temperature?,11295555672,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are plenty of factors that play into getting a good night’s rest. One of the biggest factors is sleep temperature. But what exactly is the right temperature to sleep at?</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s important to remember that room temperature isn’t the only temperature that can affect sleep. In order to fall asleep quickly and sleep soundly, your body temperature and bed temperature have to be regulated as well. Room, body, and bed temperature combined make up sleep temperature. However, there’s no one right sleep temperature for everyone. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to the proper room temperature for sleep, somewhere between 60-68 degrees generally works. To find your perfect temperature, adjust the thermostat or fan setting in your room until you find the temperature you sleep best at. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It may help to use a </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/eight-sleep-tracker?variant=34186577923""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sleep tracker </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">to measure the improvement that a change in temperature brings to your sleep. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Body temperature is another factor to bear in mind. Before bed, our body temperature naturally lowers to help us fall asleep. However, habits like sleeping under a comforter in the summer and wearing unbreathable fabrics to bed can prevent this. Always opt for 100% cotton sheets and pajamas to avoid waking up shivering or covered in sweat. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another reason that you may sleep cool or sleep hot is your mattress. Bed temperature can prevent a good night’s rest if the bed is too hot or cold. For example, certain memory foam mattresses tend to trap air, making you sleep hot. If this is the case for you, consider switching to a </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">cooling mattress such as <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">the Pod</a>, which offers dynamic cooling as low as 55 degrees Fahrenheit and as high as 110. You may not need the extremes, however it guarantees to keep you comfortable all night long.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The right sleep temperature includes room, body and bed temperature. There is no one specific temperature that works for everyone, but following the above tips can help you find the temperature that results in your best sleep yet. </span></p>",,10/14/2018 13:13,what-is-the-right-sleep-temperature,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/240_F_110841931_oy68C6G8JSz8ax3kHTTmPNnT9agYgXyK.jpg?v=1539537228,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
How Can Caffeine Influence Your Sleep?,11246501976,"<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Coffee shops all over the country today are celebrating National Coffee Day with giveaways, deals and discounts. From Dunkin Donuts </span><a href=""https://news.dunkindonuts.com/news/brewed-for-two-dunkin-donuts-celebrates-national-coffee-day-with-buy-one-hot-coffee-get-a-second-one-free-offer""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">two-fers</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to </span><a href=""https://www.krispykreme.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">free cups</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> at Krispy Kreme, your Saturday is likely to be a caffeinated one. All the hype got us thinking -- how does our caffeine obsession affect our sleep?</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To find out more, we asked Eight sleepers how much and when they consume caffeine during the day. We correlated the responses to over 3,500 nights of sleep data from our Smart Mattresses and came up with some pretty interesting answers. Here’s what you should know about caffeine and sleep:</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>More coffee equals less sleep.</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">People lose 23 more minutes of sleep when they drink 4-6 servings of caffeine during the day compared to 1-2 servings. That may seem insignificant on a nightly basis, but if you regularly drink 4-6 servings, you could be looking at 6 full days of sleep loss yearly.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Drinking coffee in the morning affects your sleep less.</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Users who drink their last cup of jo before noon sleep, on average, 20 minutes more than users who guzzle caffeine in the afternoon. Maybe you’re willing to lose those precious Zzzs, but you’ll likely be missing multiple sleep cycles in that time. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Coffee close to bedtime will delay sleep onset. </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you drink coffee in the afternoon, you’ll take, on average, 10 more minutes to fall asleep than if you only drink it in the morning. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whatever your caffeine drinking habits are, we encourage you to enjoy National Coffee Day responsibly. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All the best,</span></p>

Should You Really Sleep at 68 Degrees?,11245715544,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Like many people, you’ve likely woken up freezing or covered in sweat a few nights. Some research claims that 68 degrees is the perfect room temperature for sleep, but is it really the temperature</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> everyone </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sleeps best at?  Similar to other aspects regarding sleep, the answer is different from person to person.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">68 degrees may be ideal for some people, but figuring out your perfect sleep temperature isn’t always so simple. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What's more, your ideal sleep temperature isn’t consistent since it varies with age. As our bodies change, so should our sleep temperature. Adults should sleep anywhere from 60-68 degrees while babies and young children should sleep in a bit warmer environment, around 65-70 degrees. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleep quality decreases when temperatures radically drop or increase in the bedroom. Check to make sure your bedroom temperature is never </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8022726""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">below 54 degrees or above 75 </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">degrees since this greatly disrupts sleep. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The ideal sleep temperature varies between genders as well. Generally, women prefer to sleep in slightly warmer environments than men because of differences in metabolism. Additionally, if you have insomnia, sleeping below 68 degrees may help to improve sleep. Many studies have shown that sleeping in cooler rooms increases sleep quantity and quality.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your bed temperature also affects what temperature your room should be at night. If you sleep hot, it may be because your mattress traps heat and doesn’t  provide proper airflow. Before you touch the thermostat, consider the fact that your bed may be the main reason you sleep cool or too hot. There are smart beds like the <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">Eight Sleep Pod</a>, which allow for dynamic temperature regulation. The Pod can cool all the way down to 55 degrees Fahrenheit on each individual bed side keeping you comfortable all night long.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ultimately, 68 degrees is a great temperature to start out with. However, if you find yourself still freezing under layers of blankets, then bundle up. If you wake up sweating or shivering, increase or decrease the temperature accordingly to get the best sleep possible. </span></p>",,9/28/2018 16:39,should-you-really-sleep-at-68-degrees,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/bed_thermostat.jpeg?v=1549855326,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
Why You Sleep Hot,11202330712,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our core body temperature drops at night so we can sleep, but many people still sleep hot despite this. So what exactly causes you to sleep hot?</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Room temperature</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the easiest fixes and biggest culprits of sleeping hot is the wrong room temperature. Ideally, the temperature in your room  should be around 60-68 degrees for optimal sleep. No one likes to sweat, so set a thermostat or run a fan at night to help you sleep better.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Poor quality memory foam mattress</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A hot bed may likely be the cause of those night sweats. Many memory foam mattresses tend to sleep hot if they don’t have layers to allow proper  airflow. You don’t want your mattress to trap in moisture and heat from your body since this leads to a restless, hot night. Try the new <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">Pod by Eight Sleep</a>, which offers dynamic cooling and warming ranging from 55 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit. It is </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">designed to help you sleep cool </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">smart.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Unbreathable fabrics</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Silk and satin pajamas and bed sheets may sound luxurious, but in reality they’re not doing you any favors. Substitute unbreathable fabrics for cotton, specifically bamboo cotton, with better airflow to keep you sleeping cool. Eight’s 300 thread count organic cotton </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/all-organic-sheets?variant=34044136067""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sheets</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> are a great option that are not only cool, but comfy as well. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>High humidity</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Depending on where you live and the structure of your house, high humidity can be a problem in colder months as it is in warmer months. Try using a dehumidifier at night to avoid feeling like you’re sleeping in a Florida swamp. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Medications</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many prescriptions, especially antidepressants, have the uncomfortable side effect of sleeping hot. Even some basic over the counter pain relievers can produce this side effect in some people. If possible, consider swapping out your medication for a slightly different kind that doesn’t cause a sleep problem.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you try these fixes and still find yourself sweating each night, talk to your doctor since this could indicate a more serious problem. </span></p>",,9/18/2018 0:40,why-you-sleep-hot,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/room_ac.jpeg?v=1537245634,,open,open,Uncategorized,
Why You Sweat at Night,11202297944,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You’ve probably had many restless nights where you lay awake wondering why you can’t sleep. As it turns out, sweating at night is a common cause of sleeplessness. There are a number of possible reasons as to why you sweat at night, but luckily most of them have simple fixes. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Pillow with poor airflow</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many pillows, particularly those made of memory foam, make it too hot to sleep at night. To help you sleep cool, try a pillow with cooling gel or a more advanced kind made with special cooling nylon. Eight’s </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/the-cool-pillow?variant=12289047887960""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cool Pillow</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, an adjustable pillow that makes both sides of the pillow the cool side, is a great option that helps you avoid night sweats.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Mattress with poor airflow</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A bed that traps body heat and moisture is unsurprisingly going to cause you to sweat during the night. Replacing your hot bed with one that provides dynamic cooling like <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">the Pod</a>, </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">will help you stop sweating and start sleeping cool. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Wrong room temperature</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If your room is set at a higher temperature than about 68 degrees, you’ll likely be sweating all through the night. Make sure your room temperature isn’t too hot by shutting the blinds during the day and running a fan at night if necessary.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Too heavy bed sheets</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleeping with too many blankets on your bed, especially sheets that aren’t cotton, can cause you to sweat at night. Additionally, keeping a down comforter on your bed all year round isn’t doing your body any favors. Remove extra layers and your comforter if you find yourself being too hot to sleep. Cotton is really the only material you should have on your bed and your body at night. Untreated cotton is breathable, comfy, and cool. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Menopause</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unfortunately, hot flashes are common for women right before and during menopause. Hot flashes caused by shifts in hormones can trigger these hot flashes during the day as well as nighttime.  If you have tried everything else and suspect this is the cause of your sleep problem, talk with your doctor about ways to deal with hot flashes at night. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Alcohol before bed</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Drinking too close to bedtime, about two hours of less, can cause you to sleep hot and make it difficult to stay asleep. It messes with your body’s natural temperature decrease before bed, causing you to sweat during the night. Avoid those nightcaps if you want a better sleep.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Exercise too close to bed</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Avoid exercise at least two hours before bed. Your body naturally starts to cool down before sleep, and intense exercise can prevent your body’s thermoregulation.  Working out increases your heart rate and metabolism. This in turn increases the heat that your body produces, making it hard to sleep. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once you know why you sweat at night, it’s a lot easier to sleep cool and wake refreshed. </span></p>

How to Sleep Cool,11182669912,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sometimes it seems like there really is no beating the heat, even at night. But you don’t have to spend every night sweating instead of sleeping. Here are some of the best tips to follow when you want to sleep cool. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Freeze it</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While it’s not a permanent solution, simply sticking your folded sheets in a bag and putting them in the freezer can help you sleep cooler. You can also try this sleep hack with your pajamas. Enveloping yourself in cool materials helps you fall asleep at the perfect temperature. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Get cold feet</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since there are multiple nerve endings in feet, dipping your feet in cool water before bed helps you sleep cooler. You can also keep a small bowl of ice near your bed to rub on your temples and feet if you wake up hot in the middle of the night. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Buy cool products</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Make sure your sleep products offer breathability. Your mattress, pillow, pjs, and bed sheets all need to provide proper air circulation. Cotton sheets and pjs stop the sweat since cotton is a highly breathable fabric. When it comes to your mattress, opt for breathable materials as well. Consider a <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">mattress that offers dynamic cooling</a>, so you won’t sleep hot. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Change sleeping position</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Spread out as much as possible while you’re sleeping. Think like a starfish, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">be </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the starfish. Falling asleep in this position allows for air to circulate around your body. Sleeping sprawled out is the sleeping position most effective in reducing body heat. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Monitor diet</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eating small meals often throughout the day helps to reduce the heat caused by your metabolism. Keep in mind portion size as well as the type of food you’re eating. Don’t eat spicy foods at least three hours before bed in order to avoid sweating at night. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Shower before bed</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you don’t want to sleep hot, take a cool shower before bed. When you step out of the shower into the even cooler air, your body temperature naturally drops, making it easier to fall asleep. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Sleep alone</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Much like Drake, many people hate sleeping alone. However, sleeping in a separate bed from your partner can actually lead to better sleep for both of you. This way, you don’t have to endure extra body heat, and you can both sleep cooler. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Unplug</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Turn off the tech.  Devices like phones and computers radiate heat, making it harder to fall asleep.

Best Products for Sleeping Cool,11182637144,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While there are many </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/tips-to-stop-sweating-at-night""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">tips</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> you can use to stay cool at night, they won’t help much if your sleep products are the main culprits causing you to sleep hot. Check out the list below of the top five products to help you sleep cool.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1. Cooling mattress  </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the best mattress tips is to purchase mattress that offers proper breathability. But, with all the advances of technology, there are now solutions that go beyond that. One example is <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">the Pod</a>, the only mattress that dynamically cools to as low as 55 degrees on each bed side. This allows for the maximum cooling to keep you comfortable all night long. A cool mattress can make all the difference in sleep quality. If your mattress does not allow for proper airflow, there’s no way you’ll be able to make it through the night without sweating. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Cooling pillow</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some foam pillows are available with a cooling gel layer on one side so you don’t constantly have to flip the pillow over during the night. For those that want a cooling pillow tailored to them, the </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/the-cool-pillow?variant=12289047887960""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cool Pillow by Eight </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is a great option. It’s a customizable pillow that offers 9 possible comfort setups and is constantly cool to the touch. Rather than one simple gel layer, this pillow provides the utmost cooling with its highly breathable layers and cooling nylon material.</span><b></b></p>
<p> </p>
<li style=""display: inline !important;""><strong>3. Cotton pajamas</strong></li>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you don’t feel comfortable sleeping naked, going to bed in a pair of cotton pajamas will help you stay cool. </span><a href=""https://cottonon.com/US/women/womens-sleepwear/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cotton On </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">offers a variety of options for both men and women in many styles. Bamboo cotton is a top quality material to help you stay cool at night. While materials like silk might be more appealing, cotton pjs are far more comfy, breathable, and prevent you from waking up drenched in sweat.</span><b></b></p>
<p> </p>
<li style=""display: inline !important;""><strong>4. Cotton sheets and pillowcases</strong></li>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Like pajamas, your sheets and pillowcases should be 100% cotton as well. Since cotton is both soft and lightweight, it’s an extremely breathable material. The organic 300 thread count </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/collections/sheets""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sheets </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">from Eight ensure you sleep comfy </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> cool.</span><b></b></p>
<p> </p>
<li style=""display: inline !important;""><strong>5. Cooling eye mask</strong></li>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wearing a sleep mask to bed can not only block out light that prevents you from falling asleep, but masks with cooling gel can actually help you sleep cooler. Choose a cotton sleep mask with removable cooling gel packs for each eye.  As an added bonuses, many cool sleep masks can also help prevent puffy eyes.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By choosing the right sleeping products, you can stay cool all night long. </span></p>",,9/10/2018 14:37,best-products-for-sleeping-cool,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/sleep_white_woman_eye_mask.jpeg?v=1536604634,,open,open,Uncategorized,"Lifestyle, Product"
Are You a Morning or Night Person?,11165630552,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We probably all have an idea of whether we’re a night person or a morning person. But when it comes to figuring out when you’re actually most alert, things can get a bit more complicated.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>So just how do you determine when you’re most alert? </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The </span><a href=""http://www.cet-surveys.com/index.php?sid=61524""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">MEQ test</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, or Morningness Eveningness questionnaire, allows you to measure when your circadian rhythm gives you peak alertness, in the morning, at night, or somewhere in between. Usually, peak alertness corresponds with peak body temperature. Thus, if you’re more alert in the evening, that is when your body temperature is highest, and vice versa. This is a fairly easy self assessment with only 19 questions to determine when you are the most alert. There are also shorter versions available with about 5 questions that are more broad.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Why bother to take an MEQ assessment? </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s important to know when you are most alert so you can plan your day around it. You can schedule activities that require more mental and physical power during the hours when you’re most alert. If you’re more awake in the evening, then that is the best time to get work done. You can determine your circadian rhythm type. It’s also important to know because if you can’t shift your schedule to match your circadian rhythm, you can know you need to use light therapy to shift your body’s natural circadian rhythm. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Does it remain the same?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Keep in mind that your MEQ score </span><a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/srep45874""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">changes overtime</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. You may very well go from a morning lark to an evening owl. As we age, we alternate between morningness and evening. There are a number of factors that must be taken into account, namely gender, but the pattern tends to go  from morningness to eveningness and back to morningness. As infants, we’re high morningness, but there’s a turn towards eveningness from as early on as our toddler years. We continue on this path towards dramatically higher eveningness.  Around ages 16-19, there’s a slow change back to morningness. During adulthood, there is a gradual return towards morningness although it does not get nearly as high as it was during infancy. </span></p>",,9/4/2018 17:20,are-you-a-morning-or-night-person,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/woman_morning_meq.jpeg?v=1536096195,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
The Harm in Snoozing,11158093912,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We’ve all been there: it’s early on a Monday morning, and you’re dreading going to work. “Manic Monday” starts playing in your head, and you decide a few extra minutes won’t hurt. But don’t hit that snooze button just yet. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There is actually harm in snoozing too long after your alarm goes off. Pressing the snooze button every once in awhile won’t do much harm, but making a habit of it can actually make you feel more tired during the day. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before you wake up, you’ve typically just finished the REM cycle. So if you hit snooze as soon as your alarm goes off, your body and brain go right back into the REM cycle. As your alarm continues to go off and you keep hitting snooze, you repeatedly go in and out of this cycle. When you finally do wake up and stay up, you’ll wake up in the middle of the REM cycle. Waking up during this cycle will leave you feeling very drowsy.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Luckily, there are some products that can help prevent this. For example, Eight’s </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">smart alarm</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> can wake you up within a half hour of your alarm so you wake up during your lightest sleep stage feeling refreshed. As long as you don’t hit snooze, there’s no worry of waking up groggy in the middle of REM.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, there’s another negative result of snoozing. Usually your body is ready to get up when your alarm goes off (assuming you didn’t stay up until 2am the night before binging Netflix). However, continually hitting snooze can throw your body’s natural rhythm out of sync. This will lead to difficulty falling asleep at night because your body doesn’t know when it’s time to sleep or be awake. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As hard as it is to hear, the less you hit snooze, the better. Waking up early is never fun, but after awhile it will become easier and more natural.</span></p>",,9/1/2018 12:17,the-harm-in-snoozing,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/woman_alarm.jpeg?v=1535818672,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle

How to Choose a Mattress,11121885272,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Life is full of decisions, from choosing between salt or sugar for the rim of your margarita to picking out the perfect mattress. When it comes to making bigger financial decisions, so many options can leave you feeling overwhelmed. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Choosing a mattress is a very personal decision. We’ve created an easy way to choose a mattress that takes into account your different sleeping needs. By bearing in mind these factors, you’ll be cozy and relaxed in your new bed in no time.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Sleep position and mattress firmness</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Knowing which type of sleeper you are is the first step in choosing the right mattress for you.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Side sleepers:</b><span> Since side sleepers often move around during the night, a soft to medium level of firmness is ideal. A softer mattress helps to relieve the pressure on the neck and back that comes with sleeping on your side. 3-5.5 out of 10.</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Stomach sleepers:</strong> <span>More than any other position, stomach sleepers need proper support. A mattress that is too soft can lead to spine misalignment and lower back pain. 5-7.5 out of 10.</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Back sleepers:</strong> <span>Support and firmness should be the main factors. A mattress that is soft enough to relieve pressure points but also firm enough to prevent any spine misalignment is perfect for back sleepers. 4-7 out of 10.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><b>Budget and brand</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dropping six month’s salary on a mattress doesn’t guarantee it is better than a less expensive model. Ideally, your budget should be around $600-$1300. Bear in mind that retail stores often inflate prices. Many online mattress companies like Eight remove markups and offer </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/pages/financing""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">financing programs </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">so you can get the bed of your dreams without a nightmare of debt. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Tech obsessed and smart mattress capabilities </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Do you want your mattress to help improve the quality of your life in addition to helping you sleep better? If so, then buying a smart mattress is the best decision you can make. Smart mattresses such as those from </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/pages/mattress-collections""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">track your sleep automatically. This allows you to view sleep specifics and learn how your daily life impacts your time spent asleep. Additionally, many smart mattresses hook up to other smart devices like WeMo coffee makers and Amazon Alexa. You can either purchase a smart bed, or make any mattress smart by placing a </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/eight-sleep-tracker""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sleep tracker</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> over it.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Body type and mattress comfort </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bear in mind that mattress firmness is based on the average sleeper (about 180 pounds). Since most mattresses are designed for the average sleeper, anything in the universal comfort range or medium-firm range is ideal. The more you weigh, the harder foam has to work to support your body. A firmer mattress tends to provide the support needed for those on the heavier side (200 pounds and above). For those on the lighter side, soft mattresses are best since you don’t have to worry about sinking into the mattress. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Square footage and mattress size </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Most people opt for queen sized beds. Depending on the layout of your bedroom, a full size mattress may be the better option. You want your mattress to accommodate you and any potential partners. If you’re sleeping alone, make sure your mattress is big enough for you to roll over about one and a half times.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Additional sleepers and bounce </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Do you sleep alone or with a partner, pets, and/or kids? If you’re not sleeping alone, a mattress with minimal movement transfer is the best option. Buying a mattress with more layers of support provides less bounce, so you won’t be disturbed by anyone moving in bed next to you.</span></p>

Tips to Stop Sweating at Night,11119657048,"<p>Being too hot at night can lead to insomnia, not to mention extra loads of laundry from the sweaty sheets. Luckily, there a few things you can do to stop sweating at night.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Invest in breathable, quality sheets</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Don’t let your sheets be the cause of overheating. While satin may feel nice, cotton sheets are by far the best material since they are the most breathable. The all organic, 300 thread count cotton </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/collections/sheets""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sheet set </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">from Eight are a great choice for summer.  </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Mattress with proper air flow</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You mattress could be the main culprit when it comes to the causes of sweating. Many memory foam mattresses tend to sleep hot. Make sure to choose a bed that is both comfy </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> cool. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A cooling mattress like <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">the Pod </a>combines</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> foam with technology that dynamically cools each bed side to as low as 55 degrees. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Sleep naked or wear breathable fabrics to bed</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are so many </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/this-is-why-you-should-be-sleeping-naked""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">benefits of sleeping naked</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, one of the major ones being it helps prevent you from waking up drenched in sweat. Your body temperature naturally drops during sleep, but going to bed in PJs, especially ones that aren’t 100% cotton, could disrupt the body’s natural cycle. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Remove your bed comforter during warmer months</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Chances are you have a down comforter on your bed year round. Many people don’t think of removing their comforter all together or replacing it with a thinner quilt, but this can make all the difference. You don’t go to bed in sweatpants and socks during the summer, and you shouldn’t go to bed under a giant, warm comforter either. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Get a cooling pillow</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sometimes all it takes to stop sweating at night is new pillow. The adjustable </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/the-cool-pillow?variant=12289047887960""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cool Pillow </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">from Eight continuously gives you that “cool side of the pillow” feeling. Be sure to opt for pillowcases made of breathable fabrics as well. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Rub ice or water on your wrists before bed</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This may sound too simple to actually work, but rubbing ice or cold water on your wrists and/or hands before bed actually helps to cool you down. Your body temperature lowers before bed, and this helps to make sure you don’t overheat at night. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Check the temperature of your room</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If your room is too hot, then you’re bound to spend more time sweating than sleeping.  Make sure the thermostat in your bedroom is set to anywhere from 63-68 degrees at night. Turn on the fan or AC if needed. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you still find that you’re excessively sweating, talk to your doctor. </span></p>",,8/20/2018 13:24,tips-to-stop-sweating-at-night,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/couple_asleep_bed_sun.jpeg?v=1534785895,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle

Everything You Need to Know About Sleep Fragmentation,11110613080,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What is sleep fragmentation? Sleep fragmentation is basically repeated, short sleep interruptions during the night which leads to excessive tiredness during the day. These interruptions disrupt the natural sleep schedule and stages. While it isn’t categorized as a sleep disorder, it is often a symptom of a sleep disorder.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">People with fragmented sleep tend to fall asleep quickly but wake up multiple times during the night for short periods of time. These sleep fragmentations are not the natural ones that occur in humans but rather unnatural disturbances that lead to sleep interruptions that you remember during the daytime. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Causes </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As mentioned, sleep fragmentation is usually a symptom of a sleep disorder such as narcolepsy or sleep apnea. Experiencing body pain affects sleep fragmentation since you’re more likely to continuously awake if you’re in pain during the night. Snoring affects sleep fragmentation as well since people can wake themselves up from their own snoring. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Effects</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The biggest effect of sleep fragmentation is extreme fatigue during the day due to a lack of proper sleep. Not only can sleep fragmentation lessen your amount of sleep each night, but it can also lead to weight gain and certain mood disorders. You’re far more likely to be unhappy when you don’t get the proper amount of sleep each night. Moreover, when short sleep arousals occur frequently, it can </span><a href=""http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/17/4/723""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">lead to leg movements</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and increased snoring, making it even harder to sleep. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Treatment</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Testing for and treating an underlying sleep disorder helps with sleep fragmentation. Other treatments involve improving sleep hygiene, using tips like going to bed and waking up at the same time every day.

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleep fragmentation is very common and not something to brush aside just because it isn’t technically a sleep disorder.

Sleep Breaks,11110580312,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Falling asleep can be challenging, but actually staying asleep can be even harder. Chances are, you don’t have an uninterrupted sleep every single night. While this may sound like a problem, it isn’t necessarily always a bad thing.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are two different types of disturbances that cause sleep breaks: natural and external disturbances. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Natural </b></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your body naturally wakes you up when something is wrong, whether that is because you are sick, need to go to the bathroom, or your body is too hot or cold. This is your body’s way of making sure you stay healthy. If you weren’t awakened, you could face anything from a UTI to heat exhaustion. For example, many people get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. This isn’t as much of a problem as you think since the body wakes you up at the right time between sleep stages. In other words, you aren’t awakened during deep sleep, so it’s significantly easier to wake up and fall back asleep. Still, it can be annoying to wake up naturally during the night. You can improve your sleep and lessen sleep breaks by ensuring your room is a comfortable temperature each night and reducing the amount of water you drink an hour or less before bed. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>External </b></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">External forces such as screaming babies, noisy neighbors, and an accidental kick in the shin from a partner all interrupt sleep. When an outside force is causing you to wake up, the sleep disturbance is unnatural and thus an issue. Since it isn’t your body that’s waking you up, you’ll have a more difficult time falling back asleep. Falling back asleep may also prove harder because you’re more likely to be awakened during a cycle of deep sleep by external forces as opposed to natural ones. Additionally, it’s easy to solve natural sleep disturbances because once you go to the bathroom or grab an extra blanket, you can usually go right back to sleep. However, external disturbances that suddenly interrupt sleep jolt your brain into activity as you piece together what exactly woke you up. Often, our minds tend to wander when this happens, making it more difficult to fall asleep. You can minimize external sleep disruptions by using ear plugs and a sleep mask at night. These items will block out a lot of factors in your sleep environment that could wake you up during the night.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Waking up during the night can be annoying, but when your body is waking you up, it’s to ensure your own good health. In the end, we all want uninterrupted sleep. Try a sleep tracker to help minimize sleep disturbances. With increased understanding of sleep and the ability to see how often you wake up during the night, you’ll be able to sleep better. </span></p>",,8/15/2018 20:07,sleep-breaks,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/Untitled_design_2.jpg?v=1534425305,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
6 Factors That Affect Your Sleep,11110547544,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Having trouble falling and/or staying asleep at night can be extremely frustrating. What’s more frustrating is not knowing </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">why </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">you’re having trouble sleeping. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are a number of factors that could be negatively affecting your sleep. Luckily, there are simple solutions to each of them. Check out the top six factors that affect sleep and how to fix them. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><b>1. Caffeine</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Consuming caffeine in the evenings will lead to disrupted sleep. Be aware of the caffeine in soda, coffee, and tea. A cup of coffee after dinner or tea before bed can be calming, but make sure to opt for decaf. Caffeine free tea like Sleepy Time tea can actually help you relax and fall asleep faster. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><b>2. Smoking</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nicotine is a stimulant, making it hard for smokers to fall asleep. Smokers often have far more disputed sleep patterns as well. The more you smoke, the more likely you may be to develop insomnia. Smoking also changes your circadian rhythm which leads to poor sleep. Smoking two hours before bed makes it more likely that you’ll have a poor night’s rest. If you’re going to smoke, smoke your last cigarette of the day well before bedtime. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><b>3. Marijuana</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Smoking marijuana on the other hand can have a much different effect on sleep and sleep quality. Marijuana helps to restore the body’s natural sleep cycle. THC helps to induce sleep, but it decreases REM or dream sleep, leading to a deeper sleep. Opt for a strain of indica over sativa as indica has a more relaxing effect. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><b>4. Sleeping pills</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There is a high risk of addiction when it comes to sleeping pills. With melatonin, you’ll need an increased amount for it to work. Sleeping pills will eventually make it harder for your body to fall asleep naturally. If you do need a pill to fall asleep, limit the dosage and don’t take one every single night.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><b>5. Special Diet </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many people may feel tired during the day when fasting, but daily performance is typically not affected. However, fasting affects our sleep whether we realize it or not. Food deprivation often increases wakefulness. For those who fast during Ramadan or other religious holidays, beginning to fast for shorter amount of times for the days leading up to the fasting period can help your body become acclimated, thus reducing fasting negative effect on sleep. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><b>6. Sex</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sex before bed can make it easier to fall asleep. This is a no brainer since most people are typically exhausted after exerting so much energy. Sex also lowers cortisol, a stress related hormone that can make it difficult to fall asleep. However, this isn’t true for everyone. If you find yourself more stimulated and awake after sex, avoid it right before bed. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Being aware of what might be affecting your sleep is the first step towards a good night’s rest.</span></p>",,8/15/2018 20:03,6-factors-that-affect-your-sleep,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/bright_woman_sleeping.jpeg?v=1534377926,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
6 Habits to Change Your Sleep for the Better,11110514776,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Getting a good night’s sleep doesn’t have to be hard. There are small measures you can take nightly to ensure you wake rested, refreshed, and relax. Check out these six easy habits to improve your sleep.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1. Limit naps</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A little extra sleep doesn’t hurt, unless your </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/the-pros-and-cons-of-napping""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">naps</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> are too long and/or too close to bedtime. Limit naps to no more than an hour.  Avoid napping past 5 o’clock as it will make it harder to fall asleep at night since your body already feels rested.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>2. Shower before bed</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Showering before bed will lead to improved sleep. Your body temperature decreases during sleep, so lowering it before bed will help improve sleep. Taking a hot shower and then allowing your body to adjust to the cooler air helps to lower your internal body temperature. Ideally, you should shower about 90 minutes before you plan on going to sleep.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><b>3. Watch what you eat before bed</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eating too close to bedtime definitely affects your sleep. Certain types of food affect sleep differently than others. Eating late at night, especially sugary foods,  can increase your blood sugar, causing a sugar rush that makes it seemingly impossible to fall asleep. Foods with magnesium actually help you achieve a deeper sleep, but make sure your last meal is at least an hour before bed. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>4. Workout in the morning </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Working out before bed increases your body temperature and heart rate, two things that make it difficult to fall asleep. However, exercise before bed affects everyone differently. For some people, exhaustion from exercise before bed actually helps them sleep better. You know your body best, so avoid workout three hours or closer to bedtime if you find your sleep is negatively affected. Overall, people who exercise sleep better than those who don’t. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>5. Turn on night mode</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Blue light is emitted from screens on laptops, tablets, and phones. The shorter wavelengths in this type of light causes the body to produce less melatonin, a chemical that is important for sleep. Try reading or writing before bed instead, or turn on night mode to limit the amount of blue light emitted.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><b>6. Avoid alcohol before bed</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s easy to brush aside alcohol as having an impact on your sleep. In fact, consuming beer, wine, or liquor before bed can actually help you to fall asleep. However, alcohol three hours before bed or later will lead to disruptions during the night, and you’ll find it hard to fall asleep. Certain types of grapes contain melatonin, so indulging in a glass of wine before bed won’t necessarily disrupt sleep that much. The more alcohol you consume, the hardest it is to stay asleep at night. If your idea of a Friday night is having drinks with friends, start early and end with some mocktails to avoid a restless sleep. Besides, who doesn’t love happy hour deals? </span></p>

Why Body Temperature is Key to Good Sleep,11108810840,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are many factors that contribute to good sleep, from a supportive mattress to avoiding certain foods before bed. One of the key factors to a restful sleep is maintaining the ideal body temperature at night.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The Basics</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Body temperature is largely affected by room temperature. In order for your body to properly regulate its temperature, the conditions of your sleeping environment have to be just right. Set the temperature in your bedroom around 61-68 to help you fall and stay asleep comfortably. If external temperature conditions aren’t right, then your body will alternate between shivering and sweating (except during Rapid Eye Movement or</span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/the-difference-between-rem-and-deep-sleep""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> REM</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">), making for an unpleasant sleep.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">During the REM sleep stage, your body stops regulating temperature on its own. Instead, your body takes on the temperature of your environment. Humans become temporarily cold blooded during REM. If the temperature in your room varies greatly from the temperature your body was at before REM, then you’ll become very cold or wake up drenched in sweat. When you come out of REM sleep, you may shiver or sweat if your room (and consequently body temperature) isn’t comfortable. Extreme temperature changes can wake you up and make it hard to fall back asleep.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The Answers</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your body temperature naturally drops during sleep so your brain can enter deep sleep and changes throughout the night. During NREM sleep, both your body and brain temperature decrease. In order to get the proper amount of restful sleep each night during all sleep stages, there are a few things you can do regarding temperature.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleep happens when your core temperature drops. If your core temperature doesn't drop or doesn’t drop enough, you’ll have trouble falling and staying asleep. To help your core temperature drop, shower before bed. This actually helps to cool your body down when your warm body steps into the colder air after showering. Wearing breathable fabrics to bed (namely cotton) also helps you to sleep well. Additionally, buying a pillow and sheets that allow for proper air flow are key to ensuring your body temperature stays where it needs to be. The breathable, 100% organic </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/collections/sheets""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">cotton sheets from Eight </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">are a great option. If you still find that you’re sleeping too hot, try a mattress with dynamic cooling like the </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"" mce-data-marked=""1""><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">Pod </a>by Eight Sleep</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The bottom line is if your body temperature isn’t ideal, then your sleep won’t be either.

How Much Sleep Do I Need?,11064279128,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How many hours of sleep did you get last night? Was it enough so that you woke up feeling rested? While many people believe eight hours of sleep each night is what everyone needs, that’s actually a bit of a misconception. So how much sleep do you actually need?</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The answer is different for everyone, and it depends on a number of factors. There’s a difference between getting just enough sleep to survive and getting the right amount of sleep each night so you thrive, both physically and mentally.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Genes</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We all know that one person who claims to only need a few hours of sleep each night and seem to miraculously function just fine. In reality, only 1% of people are born with the genes to thrive on six hours of sleep or less. So while some people may think they’re thriving on six hours of sleep or less, they’re actually only getting enough sleep to survive. If they got the proper amount of sleep each night, they’d be more productive during the day overall and would actually increase their chances of living a longer,healthier life. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The body rejuvenates itself during sleep, so it’s important to sleep long enough that your body has time to do its thing. The majority of adults need anywhere from 7-8.5 hours per night in order for their bodies and minds to thrive.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Age</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since teenagers bodies are still developing, it makes more sense that they’d need more sleep than adults to thrive, about 8.5-10 hours. Most teenagers only get enough sleep to survive, but an increase of sleep could help them thrive academically and improve their health.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By that logic, many people wrongly believe that the elderly need less sleep because their bodies are fully developed. The reasoning that older people need less sleep to thrive is actually a myth. It was assumed since older people have a harder time staying asleep that they don’t need as much sleep. However, maintaining the same amount of sleep at 65 that you had at 35 can actually help to improve overall health and possibly decrease age related cognitive decline. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Gender</b></p>
<p><a href=""https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-news/do-women-need-more-sleep-men""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Multiple studies </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">have found that women need more sleep than men. Women need about twenty more minutes of sleep each night than men. Why? Women generally tend to use more of their brain since they multitask, leading to an increased need for sleep. Additionally, women go through more hormonal changes than men i.e. menopause and pregnancy, so their bodies need extra sleep. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ultimately, everybody needs a different amount of sleep. Getting the right amount of sleep each night will help both your body and mind to thrive.  In order to achieve the optimum amount of sleep, you need to know exactly how much sleep you’re currently getting. A sleep tracker like E</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ight’s built in </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/eight-sleep-tracker?variant=34186577923""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sleep tracker</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> will tell you how much sleep you’re getting and how to improve it. </span></p>",,7/27/2018 23:07,how-much-sleep-do-i-need,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/woman_waking_up_2.jpeg?v=1532747241,,open,open,Uncategorized,
How to Fall Asleep Faster,11056873560,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">From counting sheep to popping melatonin, you’ve probably heard a lot of different methods to help you fall asleep. But what techniques actually help you fall asleep faster?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Clear your mind</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We all tend to have a million things run through our heads as soon as we lay down at night. Midnight on a work night isn’t exactly the time you want to think about your ex or that time you accidentally called your teacher “mom” in middle school. Set aside some time each night to clear your mind before bed. A simple breathing exercise can help you fall asleep quicker. A short meditation or mindfulness session can also help to clear your mind and make you feel more relaxed before bed. There are plenty of free meditation apps available like Calm, and the Eight app has recorded meditation sessions as well.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Sleep soundly</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether you need to drown out noisy neighbors or just want to listen to some relaxing noises as you fall asleep, putting on some ambient noise can help sleep to come quickly. You can choose from a variety of sounds, from waves crashing to cats purring.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Schedule worry time</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We all have stressors in our lives, and it’s only natural to spend time worrying. Unfortunately, many of us tend to spend time worrying once we climb into bed for the night, making it nearly impossible to fall and stay asleep. Try to set aside some time at least an hour or so before bed to go over your thoughts. Often writing down some of your worries and realizing that many things are out of your control helps you fall asleep sooner and ultimately sleep better.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Avoid the obvious</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s so tempting to end the day by watching television or scrolling through Instagram, but the blue light emitted from screens makes it very difficult to fall asleep quickly. Avoid screens as well as caffeine at least a couple of hours before bed. Another habit to avoid? Taking naps too late in the day and napping longer than a half hour or so will mess up your body’s natural clock, making it harder to fall asleep at night.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Wake up schedule consistency</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the main ways to fall asleep faster is to </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/sleep-wake-time-consistency""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">regulate your sleep schedule. </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Waking up and falling asleep at around the same time every day is so important. Once your body gets used to a sleep schedule, you’ll find you fall asleep quickly and easily.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Body temperature</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Body temperature naturally drops during sleep. So before bed, you don’t want your body temperature to increase. This means no late night exercise; get that gym time in during the early morning. Additionally, taking a warm bath or shower before bed helps you to relax and fall asleep quicker; it actually helps to lower your body temperature after you step into the cool air post shower. You can achieve this same effect with a <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">smart bed</a> too, which offer dynamic temperature regulation to relax you and help you fall asleep and stay soundly asleep.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By following these easy methods, you’ll be able to fall asleep faster each night. Sweet dreams! </span></p>",,7/25/2018 15:50,how-to-fall-asleep-faster,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/can_t_sleep.jpeg?v=1532548227,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
Best Mattress for Sex,11033444440,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Floors are for dancing; they are not for comfortable sex. However, when shopping for a mattress, comfort is one of the most important things to take into account. You want a mattress that is perfect for both your sleep and your sex life. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There a few main factors that indicate the best mattress for sex. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Firmness</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This one may seem obvious, but a firm bed is crucial. You don’t want a bed that is so soft you sink into it. Since your bed can’t pop a pill to fix that problem, opt for a medium firm to firm mattress. You want the weight of two people to be distributed evenly, no matter what positions you’re in. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Breathability </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s important to choose a mattress that doesn’t trap heat. Chances are, you get sweaty enough without a heat trapping mattress adding to it. Make sure you pick a mattress like the </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/the-mars-plus?variant=43186834371""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mars + </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">that is made with extra breathable foam and spring coils to help improve air flow. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Size</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It does matter. An intimate moment can be ruined in an instant if one of you suddenly falls off of the bed. You want to ensure that your bed is large enough so that you both can enjoy those steamy nights.</span></p>

<p><b>Minimal to zero noise</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nothing can kill a mood more than a squeaky bed. Whether you have kids, roommates, or just thin walls in your apartment, a silent bed is key when it comes to uninhibited sex. Foam mattresses and hybrid beds are overwhelmingly more quiet than innerspring beds. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Comfort</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If your mattress is uncomfortable, you’ll be uncomfortable. Sex is to be enjoyed; it’s not something to rush through because of back pain from an unsupportive mattress. Instead, choose a mattress with many layers of premium, supportive foam like any of </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/pages/mattress-collections""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight’s foam mattresses</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The mattress needs to fit your bodies as you move so you feel supported; it should bounce back a bit instead of just engulfing you.You’re going to be moving a lot, so a mattress with minimal movement transfer is ideal.

Sleep-Wake-Time Consistency,11033411672,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re looking for tips for sleep that actually work, you’re not alone. The most important thing you can do for better sleep is regulate sleep wake time consistency. You can’t have mac and cheese without cheese, and you can’t have good sleep without routine.  But just how do you regulate it?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Consistency is crucial because your body needs to get in natural and healthy habits to improve your sleep quality and avoid sleep deprivation and oversleeping.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Wake time consistency</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You must wake up at or very near to the same time every single day, even on weekends. Use the Eight app to set an alarm for around the same time every day. The timing doesn’t have to be within the minute because waking up during your lightest sleep stage is key to not feeling groggy during the day. The </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight Sleep thermo alarm </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">wakes you up within a half hour of your alarm, when you’re in your lightest sleep period. After awhile your body will automatically wake up at that time, no alarms necessary. There’s no need to be overly ambitious and set an extra early wake up time that is unrealistic. Set a wake up time that works for you. Waking up and falling asleep at the same time daily can ensure that you get the right amount of sleep needed to remain alert during the day.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><b>Sleep restriction </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are two automatic processes that affect our sleep: sleep pressure (sleep homeostasis) and circadian rhythm (the body’s natural clock). To improve sleep, we initially need to limit the time we spend in bed. Tossing and turning for hours isn’t helping you fall asleep. We need to allow these processes to impact our sleep schedules, but only to an extent. There’s only a certain amount of sleep needed nightly. In order to avoid oversleeping, track your sleep with a </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">smart bed</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to see how many hours you actually need per night.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Meal consistency </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Achieving better sleep requires consistency during the day as well. Eating at the same time every day helps to strengthen our bodies’ natural clock. Planning the timing of meals in advance helps you avoid eating meals too close to bedtime, a habit that can make it challenging to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><b>Bedtime reminder</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">First, it’s imperative to understand what bedtime actually means. A bedtime is not the time you start winding down; it is the time you are actually in bed by trying to fall asleep. We’re all guilty in getting so caught up in our own lives that we can skimp on sleep. In order to get the proper amount of rest (generally around 7-8 hours for the average adult), set a bedtime reminder for the same time each night. Have an alert go off about an hour before you need to be in bed. This allows you time to settle down without rushing to bed.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A consistent sleep schedule is a healthy sleep schedule. Maintaining proper sleep hygiene takes work, but consistency ultimately leads to even healthier days and nights.</span></p>",,7/21/2018 1:57,sleep-wake-time-consistency,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/woman_asleep_alarm.jpeg?v=1532152669,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle

Best Mattress for Stomach Sleepers,11009589336,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some habits are hard to break. Take sleeping on your stomach for example. It isn’t considered the best position to sleep, but we know that any way you fall asleep and stay asleep is a good way. That’s why we’ve broken down into categories the qualities that make a mattress perfect for stomach sleepers. Keeping the following factors in mind can help stomach sleepers get an even better sleep without the struggle of breaking any habits.</span></p>
<p><strong>Pillow</strong></p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before we talk about mattresses, it should be noted that sleeping with a pillow can make all the difference. Stomach sleepers should place put a small pillow under their abdomen to help keep their spine in alignment. Little tricks like this can help your body rest better when sleeping on your stomach.</span></p>
<p><b>Support</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Proper support is so important for stomach sleepers to help prevent pain in the lower back and spine. Your back and hips need to be supported so you’re able to fall asleep in a comfortable position on your stomach. Premium foam mattresses like </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/the-jupiter-plus?variant=43186795843""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Jupiter+ </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">with 10 inches of foam are ideal for stomach sleepers because they adjust to your body’s position.</span></p>
<p><b>Firmness</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mattress firmness is key in determining the perfect mattress for those who sleep on their stomachs. Stomach sleepers should avoid extra soft mattresses; sinking too far into the bed will be uncomfortable and can potentially lead to back problems.  If a mattress is too soft, it can also lead to misaligning your spine. You want to sleep on a mattress, not in it. A medium firm to firm mattress such as </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/the-jupiter-plus?variant=43186795843""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Jupiter+ </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(medium firmness) and </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/the-saturn-plus?variant=43186714819""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Saturn+</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (medium-firm firmness) is the best choice.</span></p>
<p><b>Air flow</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleeping on your stomach can cause heat to become trapped, and no one wants to wake up drenched in sweat. That’s why it’s important to have a breathable mattress. Many foam mattresses tend to sleep hot, but Eight’s unique foam combinations allow for proper air flow.</span></p>
<p><b>Pressure relief/Contour </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nobody wants to experience pain when sleeping, no matter what sleep position you prefer. When sleeping on your stomach, it’s especially important that a mattress provides pressure relief. In order to prevent spine misalignment, choose a mattress that consists partly of  contouring memory foam such as the </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/the-jupiter-plus?variant=43186795843""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Jupiter + </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">that also supports the hips and back.</span></p>
<p><b>Size</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mattress size may seem irrelevant when picking the right mattress for stomach sleepers, but it can actually play a factor in sleep. Sleepers who tend to curl up into a ball don’t need as much room as stomach sleepers, so a full size bed will likely be roomy enough for them. For stomach sleepers who tend to spread out their arms and legs, a queen or king sized bed is probably needed. If you sleep with a partner, you might also want to consider a cali king.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You may sleep on your stomach, but you shouldn’t get a knot in it when it comes to picking the right mattress. With layers of support and the right firmness, The Jupiter + and The Saturn+ are both great options for stomach sleepers (not to mention they’re out of this world comfortable!).</span></p>",,7/12/2018 13:38,best-mattress-for-stomach-sleepers,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/girl_stomach_sleeper.jpeg?v=1531456135,,open,open,Uncategorized,"Lifestyle, the-jupiter-plus, the-saturn-plus"
How Sleeping With a Partner Can Affect Your Sleep,11009425496,"<p>Sleeping with someone else in your bed affects your sleep, both positively and negatively. There are many downfalls of sleeping with a partner, but almost all of them can be fixed with a few simple tricks.  Here are the major ways that sleeping with a partner changes the way you sleep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Snoring</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In almost every couple, there is likely to be snorer. Snoring can keep you awake all night and negatively affect your sleep. Having your partner sleep on their side can help to prevent snoring. Additionally, propping their head up with a comfortable pillow will help to cease the snores so you both can get uninterrupted sleep.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Conflicting Temperature Preferences</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some like it hot while others prefer a cool mattress. No one should have to compromise when it comes to good sleep quality. Thankfully, there are a number of smart mattress options that allow you to adjust the temperature of each side of the bed individually. </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight’s smart mattresses</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> can even heat up and cool down each side of the bed automatically during the night so you can always fall into a warm, cozy bed or a chilly cold one of that's of your liking.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Blanket Hogging</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We can’t help with your partner using the last of the toilet paper and not replacing it, but there’s a simple solution for when your partner takes all of the blanket. If one of you constantly pulls the covers, it can lead to a restless, sleepless night. Each of you simply sleeping with your own blanket will make all the difference.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Tossing and Turning</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If your partner is a restless sleeper who constantly tosses, turns, and occasionally kicks you in their sleep, it undoubtedly prevents you from getting a good night’s sleep. However, it may not actually be their fault. Tossing and turning could mean that the mattress is actually the issue. An old and/or uncomfortable mattress can cause both you and your partner to get a poor night’s rest. Look into replacing your mattress to stop the tossing and turning for good. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Conflicting Schedules </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Chances are, your sleep schedules aren’t identical. One of you may wake up earlier than the other and consequently wake up your partner unintentionally.  To avoid this, choose a mattress with minimal to no movement transfer; <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">foam mattresses</a> like are great for this.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Strengthens relationship </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the ways that sleeping with a partner can positively affect your sleep is that it makes you feel more connected in your relationship.  Falling asleep next to a warm body each night relaxes you and makes it easier to fall asleep. Plus, who doesn’t love cuddling with someone they love and trust?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleeping with a partner completely changes the way that you sleep, but by following the above tips, you can both get a good night’s sleep every night. </span></p>",,7/12/2018 12:57,how-sleeping-with-a-partner-can-affect-your-sleep,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/couple_asleep.jpeg?v=1531415503,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
The Difference Between REM and Deep Sleep,11009327192,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All sleep is not the same. You’ve probably heard about light sleep and deep sleep, and many often equate deep sleep with REM sleep. Just as </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/the-difference-between-light-and-deep-sleep-how-much-do-you-really-need""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">light and deep sleep are different </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">from one another, REM and deep sleep are two completely different sleep stages, each with defining characteristics. There are five different stages of sleep, all which contribute to your body’s </span><a href=""https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/what-circadian-rhythm""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">circadian rhythm</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, or natural body clock. REM and deep sleep are stages three and four of sleep.  </span></p>
<p><b>REM</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rapid eye movement, or REM sleep, </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is the deepest sleep stage. The eyes move more rapidly in all directions during REM sleep, </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">a</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">s its name indicates. REM is the</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> fourth stage of sleep.</span></p>
<b>
<li>Time: <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">REM sleep occurs approximately 90 minutes after you fall asleep. </span>
</li>
</b><b>
<li>Body: <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your heart beats faster, and your heartbeat will likely become irregular during REM. Aside from a change in heartbeat, the body is largely inactive during this phase of sleep. </span>
</li>
</b><b>
<li>Brain: <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">REM sleep is associated with intense brain activity.  This is the stage where you’ll likely experience active and vivid dreams. Sleepwalking and bedwetting incidents occur only during REM. REM sleep restores your brain and is important for your learning as well as your memory.</span>
</li>
</b><b>
<li>Length: <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are different periods of REM sleep, the first lasting about 10 minutes. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are about three to five periods of REM stages per night.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The length of </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">REM stages increase throughout the night, and the final stage can be up to an hour. </span>
</li>
</b><br>
<p><b>Deep Sleep </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Deep sleep is non rapid eye movement, or NREM. There are three other NREM stages as well. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Other names for this deep sleep stage are slow-wave sleep, delta sleep, and N3 since this is the third stage of sleep.</span></p>
<b>
<li>Time: <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The body enters deep sleep anywhere from a half hour to 45 minutes after falling asleep. </span>
</li>
</b><b>
<li>Body: <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unlike REM, deep sleep is known for the changes in your body rather than your brain. Your breathing slows and your heartbeat is regular during this stage. The muscles in your body become completely relaxed, and you typically sleep through any external sleep distractions such as loud noises. Deep sleep is extremely important to overall health because it’s during this phase that the body naturally heals itself. Your body replaces cells, heals wounds, and builds muscle tissue, all while you’re sound asleep.</span>
</li>
</b><b>
<li>Brain: <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are almost always no dreams during this period of sleep. Although naturally unlikely, if you do wake up during deep sleep, you’ll feel groggy and disoriented at first. It is during light sleep that you wake up the easiest. Smart alarms like </span><a href=""https://content.eightsleep.com/2017/04/11/stay-woke-eight-smart-alarm-explained/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the Eight sleep tracker </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">wake you up within a half hour of your alarm so you can always awake feeling refreshed. </span>
</li>
</b><b>
<li>Length: <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Deep sleep</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">usually lasts anywhere from 1-2 hours, or 20-25% of your overall sleep. Some people may need more deep sleep than others as every sleeper is different.</span>

8 Simple Ways to Improve Your Sleep,10989961304,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Almost all of us could use a better night’s sleep. Chances are, you’re tired even as you read this. Yet improving your sleep can seem like a daunting, complicated, and even impossible task. Luckily, there are a few basic, easy to follow tips that can help to improve sleep.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1. Turn off the tech</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You probably know by now that watching reruns Seinfeld on your laptop or ipad isn’t good for your sleep. But what you might not know is the reason staring at screens before bed is so detrimental to your sleep. The blue light emitted from screens wakes you up, and turning on night mode doesn’t solve the problem. Watching shows or reading articles stimulates the brain and makes it harder to fall asleep. Try reading a familiar book instead.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2. Watch your diet before bed</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Resisting late night snacking is hard. I’ve fallen asleep many nights cuddling a bag of pretzels in a bed full of crumbs. Yet many foods before bedtime can leave you unable to fall and stay asleep. For example, </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4330685/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">cheese may cause nightmares</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, and acidic and spicy foods can potentially awaken you with a stomach ache. If you find yourself craving a little snack, many fruits and nuts are perfect alternatives that don’t cause poor sleep.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3. Exercise during the day</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Exercise and sleep are both part of a healthy lifestyle, but exercise can interfere with a good night’s rest if it’s done too close to bedtime. Avoid exercise at least 3 hours before you plan on to sleep. This allows your body enough time to relax before falling asleep.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>4. Improve your sleep environment</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Calming colors like light blue actually have an affect on your sleep. Aside from interior design aspects, you want to ensure that your sleep environment is cool, clean, and quiet. The ideal temperature for sleep is around 60-68 degrees. You can use the Eight sleep app to automatically adjust the temperature in your room every night. Using ear plugs or a white noise machine can block out any outside noise so you can easily fall asleep. Sleep hygiene is also important when it comes to your sleep environment. You want your sheets and pillowcases to be clean to help you improve your sleep. Washing your sheets every couple of weeks is an easy way to help you sleep better.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>5. Only use your bed for sleep and sex</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At one point or another, we’ve all been guilty of eating, reading, or watching hours of television in our beds. While comfort is nice, a good night’s sleep is even better. If you do anything in your bed aside from sleeping and having sex, your brain will begin to associate other daytime activities with your bed, making it harder to fall asleep.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>6. Make sure your mattress and pillows are comfortable</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This may seem obvious, but it’s an important aspect that many people don’t realize. If your bed is old and sagging, it could be the reason you’re not falling or staying asleep because you are so uncomfortable. Ideally, your mattress should support your entire body. There are many mattresses, like </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight’s mattresses</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> made with at least three layers of foam, that can help you sleep better simply by improving your comfort.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>7. Keep a consistent sleep schedule sleep</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is the number one thing you can do to improve your sleep. Always go to bed around the same time every night and wake up at the same time each morning. Resisting the urge to sleep in on weekends is hard, but it becomes easier once you train your body's internal clock.  If you find yourself still struggling with insomnia, talk to your doctor for additional tips.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>8. Avoid liquids an hour before bed</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hydration is important, but so is sleep. Go to the bathroom right before bed to avoid waking up in the middle of the night for bathroom breaks that can prevent you from falling back asleep. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Remember that change doesn’t happen immediately.

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Chances are, you and your partner have different sleeping preferences, and many common mattress brands aren’t designed with the sleep needs of two different people in mind. Who hasn’t fought over temperature preferences? Luckily, there are products that can eliminate some of these petty fights and morning moodiness.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A</span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/study-finds-lack-of-sleep-could-hurt-your-relationship""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> lack of sleep can actually hurt your relationship</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, so it’s crucial that you and your partner find a mattress suited for both of your sleep needs. Luckily, Eight provides </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/pages/mattress-collections""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">three mattress options</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> great for couples. But what exactly makes the Eight the best smart bed for couples?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The major components that make a mattress perfect for couples are:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Minimal or no motion transfer</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If one or both of you tosses and turns during that night, it can have a negative impact on your partner’s sleep. To avoid disturbing their sleep (and potential grumpiness), a bed with low motion transfer is important.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Ability to sleep at different temperatures</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While no mattress can save you fights over who hogs the blankets at night,  beds with dual zone temperature capabilities like </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight smart mattresses </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">can prevent those arguments over temperature preferences.  If one of you prefers to sleep cool while the other enjoys the cozy warmth of a bed, just adjust the temperature on each side of the bed to suit your preferences. You can even set individual temperatures to automatically turn on and off at certain times every day and night.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Firmness that fits that needs of both people</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Options are so important when it comes to finding the right mattress, but much like moving in with your partner, they can be overwhelming. Any good mattress brand should allow you to eliminate the low quality options.   With a trusted brand like Eight Sleep, you can </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/compare/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">choose a mattress</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> the perfect mattress for you.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></p>
<p><b>Comfort </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You’re never going to agree on everything in relationships, but both of you can agree on wanting a comfortable bed. The most comfortable mattresses have multiple foam layers. Each Eight mattress type for example has three or more layers for maximum comfort. They are designed with layers of premium foam, durable foam, or premium foam with pocket spring coils.  All three designs provide the utmost comfort for both sleepers. An added bonus? Mattresses made of foam are better at isolating movement.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Affordability </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Are you and your partner on a budget but still want better sleep? Avoid the age old money arguments by buying an affordable mattress with finance options. Many retailers like Eight offer finance options so you can pay for your smart mattress over time. In fact, you don’t necessarily even need to purchase a smart mattress to reap many of the benefits of one. The Eight sleep tracker is unique in that it can fit over your existing mattress. Who said an old dog can’t learn new tricks?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Sleep tracking </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What is a relationship without a little innocent competition? By using a sleep tracker, you can see who got a better sleep score each night. Most sleep trackers can only track one person’s sleep, but Eight’s </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"" mce-data-marked=""1"">sleep tracking</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> allows you to track that of your partner’s as well. Eight’s built in piezo sensors track your individual heart and respiratory rates, time slept, and more. With the analyzed data, you can both gain valuable insight on how to improve your sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><img src=""//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/products/Eight_-_tracker_608x556_2_d609ce6c-5702-4fe3-91d8-e565a124d5d8_large.png?v=1523894339"" alt="""" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your bed should ultimately improve the quality of your sleep and help to make life a little easier. Smart mattresses with </span><a href=""https://ifttt.com/eight""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">IFTTT </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">integration system allow you to connect your smart bed with other smart devices in your home, such as the WeMo coffeemaker. This way, you can prevent those little arguments about whose turn it is to brew coffee. IFTTT can also connect to Amazon’s Alexa. Want to change the temperature of your side of the bed? Simply tell Alexa to raise or lower the temperature.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With all of the above features combined, the </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pod</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is undoubtedly the best mattress for couples.

How to Keep a Consistent Sleep Schedule,10986029144,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">No one wants to wake up early on weekends, but ultimately for better sleep, you should be waking up and falling asleep at roughly the same time everyday. It’s not always easy to start and stick to a schedule, but there are a few sleep tricks to help you keep a consistent sleep schedule while also improving sleep hygiene.</span></p>
<p><b>Set a bedtime</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Chances are, you wake up at roughly the same time each morning for work or class. You may be tempted to stay up later on weekends and consequently wake up later, but you must pick a specific time to wake up and fall asleep. Setting an alarm each morning seems obvious, but make sure to set an alarm at night as well. Once you repeat this long enough, eventually your body’s internal clock, or circadian rhythm, will grow accustomed to the new bedtime. This will eventually lead to you falling asleep and waking up at the same time daily without even thinking about it.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><img src=""//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/bed_calender_medium.jpeg?v=1530246227"" alt="""" width=""439"" height=""291""></span></p>
<p><b>Make a bedtime routine </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You have a morning routine to help you wake up in the morning, and the same should go for nighttime. To improve sleep, think of some activities to do before bed that relax you and help to power down your body. Whether it’s a cup of sleepy time tea with your favorite book or doing a simple activity like a puzzle, these activities when repeated nightly signal to your brain that it’s time to sleep. </span></p>
<p><b>Take a warm bath</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While this isn’t an activity that has to be done nightly, it can be particularly useful if you’re experiencing insomnia. Soaking in a warm bath before bed relaxes your body and mind. When your body is at a warmer temperature, it can be easier to fall and stay asleep. The best part about this trick to sleep better is that you actually </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">want </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">to do it. Throw in some scented bath salts, put on soothing music, and you’ll begin to unwind in no time.</span></p>
<p><b>Meditate</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Meditation can seem intimidating for beginners, but there’s really no right or wrong way to meditate. Simply taking time before bed to shut down your mind and try to put to sleep racing thoughts will make it easier to put </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">yourself </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">to sleep. There are many free apps available to guide you through meditation. The Eight app actually features recorded </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t3je5-Leco&amp;feature=youtu.be""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">meditation sessions </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">to listen to before falling asleep each night. </span></p>
<p><b>Turn your lights off at the same time nightly</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Look, even as adults some of us still like to leave every bright light in the house on after having watched a scary movie at night. Yet those bright lights make your body and brain more alert, making it harder to fall asleep at the same time every night. To signal to your body that it’s time for bed, dim the lights or turn them off completely at the same time every night. It can be hard to remember to do this every night, but luckily there are products that can do it for you automatically. You can connect the </span><a href=""https://ifttt.com/eight""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight sleep tracker with Hue </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">lights to automatically dim lights and/or shut them off at a certain time each night.</span></p>
<p><b>Use a sleep tracker</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To sleep better and keep a consistent sleep schedule, there’s no better tool than a sleep tracker. Sleep trackers analyze how well you slept the night before, what time you fell asleep and woke up, and much more. Many sleep trackers like </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/eight-sleep-tracker?variant=34186577923""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight’s smart cover </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">track your sleep accurately and automatically each night. Having this information and important tips to improve your sleep schedule readily available makes it easier to keep a regular sleep schedule. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The most important thing to remember is that change doesn’t happen overnight. You can start by adjusting your bedtime slightly each night (10 or 20 minute intervals) until you eventually reach your desired bedtime. Maintaining a regular sleep schedule is a challenge at first, but in the end it will lead to you sleeping better and waking up feeling rested and ready for the day.</span></p>",,6/29/2018 0:24,how-to-keep-a-consistent-sleep-schedule,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/alarm_clock_sleeping.jpeg?v=1530246459,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle

<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“You sleep like a rock! This week you've tossed and turned on average 10 times per night. This is much lower than the average for people your age, which is 25 toss and turns per night.” </span></li>

What is a Hybrid Mattress?,10722115672,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You’ve probably heard about the traditional innerspring mattresses as well as the more recent memory foam beds. But now there’s a new mattress on the market: the hybrid mattress. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>What is a hybrid mattress?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hybrids combine the best features of innerspring and memory foam mattresses using both materials. If you don’t want to give up the feel of a traditional spring mattress but need the pressure relief and support provided by foam, a hybrid is the perfect choice. The body contouring and back support make hybrids an excellent option.</span></p>
<p><b>What’s the real difference from other mattress types? </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Innerspring mattress only contain coils, and memory foam mattresses only have layers of foam. Hybrids contain roughly the same size coils as innerspring mattresses tucked under layers of foam. Because hybrids combine the best of both worlds, the mattress cost is sometimes a bit more than air beds or innerspring mattresses. A few extra pennies is a small price to pay for a few extra hours of comfortable, relaxing sleep each night.</span></p>
<p><b>What are the benefits? </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">No matter if you’re a stomach sleeper, back sleeper, or side sleeper, hybrid mattresses give your body the support it needs for a restful sleep. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With hybrids, you get the bounciness from the springs as well as the phenomenal support from the memory foam. You also don’t have to worry about limited options since hybrids come in a variety of sizes from multiple companies. The breathability of hybrids further adds to their comfortable nature.</span></p>

Mattress Buying Guide: How to Shop for a Mattress,10667917400,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Picking a new mattress isn’t like buying a house, but it definitely requires a lot of thought and often brings about anxiety.  Purchasing a mattress is a big financial investment, so it’s important to take your time in finding the mattress that’s right for you. With so many options, the choice can become very stressful. Luckily, we know a lot about sleep, thanks to the over 10,000,000 hours of sleep that we’ve analyzed to understand what helps people sleep better. With this information at hand, we’ve put together the ultimate mattress buying guide to eliminate potential stress and help you in choosing a new mattress.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Before shopping:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>When is the best time to buy a mattress? </strong></p>
<p>The first thing to know is <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/when-to-replace-your-mattress""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">when to buy a new mattress</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. The answer depends on a number of factors, but on average an innerspring mattress should be replaced every 6-7 years while memory foam and latex mattress should be replaced every 7-8 years. Here are a few questions to ask yourself before buying a new mattress:</span></p>
<p>-Are you waking up frequently during the night?</p>
<p>-Do you wake up with aches and pains?</p>
<p>-Do you notice your mattress sagging?</p>
<p>-Does a bed of cacti sound more comfortable than sleeping in your own bed?</p>
<p><strong>Is your mattress older than 6 years?</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If the answer to one or more of these questions is yes, then it’s probably time to buy a new mattress. Of course, an old mattress may not be the cause of your insomnia or back pain, so talk to your doctor first.</span></p>
<p><b>What is the difference between mattress options?</b></p>
<p>How to choose the right mattress? Choosing a mattress can be a challenge, especially since one size does not fit all. Familiarize yourself with the different mattress types out there and the pros and cons of each.</p>
<p><b>Innerspring mattress: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">traditional and most common mattress, high motion transfer </span></p>
<p><b>Memory foam mattress: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">made of different memory foam layers, provide support and pressure relief, some tend to sleep hot, medium firmness</span></p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>Hybrid mattress:</b> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">combination of latex, memory, other foam types and coils, typically pricey but offer the best of both worlds, medium-soft firmness</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><img src=""//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/hybrid_large.jpg?v=1523995448"" alt="""" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""></span></p>
<p><b>Size matters</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re someone who tosses and turns in your sleep, opt for a larger bed like a king bed. If you’re on the shorter side and tend to sleep as still as a vampire in a coffin, save money by purchasing a twin size mattress. Eight offers </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/pages/mattress-size-guide""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">mattresses in all sizes</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-</span><b>California king:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> 72 x 84 inches</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-</span><b>King:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> 76 x 80 inches</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-</span><b>Queen:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> 60 x 80 inches</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-</span><b>Double:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> 54 x 75 inches</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-</span><b>Twin:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> 39 x 75 inches</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-</span><b>Twin XL: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> 39 X 80 inches</span></p>
<p><b>Should I buy a smart mattress?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Just as important as size and type, you must decide between a standard or smart mattress. A smart mattress will offer more features than a standard one, such as </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/pages/mattress-collections""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sleep tracking</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, bed temperature regulation, and even a smart alarm. These features can help optimize your sleep to make sure you get the most of every night. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now that you know what mattress type is right for you, ask yourself if anyone else will be sleeping in it as well. Realistically, is it only going to be you sleeping on this mattress, or will a significant other be sleeping in it a majority of the time? Do your kids often crawl into bed with you? These are all factors to consider as everyone’s mattress needs are different. If you will be sharing the bed with others, choosing a foam, latex, or memory foam mattress like </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/the-jupiter-plus?variant=43186795843""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Jupiter </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">mattress will minimize motion transfer for a more restful sleep.</span></p>

<h2><b>During Shopping:</b></h2>
<p><b>Don’t rush </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once you’ve decided on the type of mattress that is right for your sleep needs, you may want to purchase it immediately. But don’t jump into your new bed so fast. Chances are, that “limited time sale” isn’t so limited; there will likely be another sale in a month or so. Comparing and negotiating prices can be exhausting, so let the experts do it for you. Talk to our sleep experts anytime by clicking the chat button on site or calling 1 888 699 4015.</span></p>
<p><b>Try before you buy</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You wouldn’t buy a car without test driving it, and the same should be true of a mattress. Testing a mattress allows you to check for proper support and comfort. Realistically, you won’t be able to know if a mattress is right for you by laying on it in a department store for 5 minutes. Many brands like Eight offer </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/pages/the-100-night-trial""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">free 100 night trials</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. If you don’t love your new mattress, Eight will refund your money and pick up the mattress for free!</span></p>
<p><b>Where to buy</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So you’ve decided on the type of mattress you want, now it comes down to where to buy it.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Purchasing </span><b>in store</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is often pricer, but it can provide more guidance since a salesperson is there to answer all of your questions. Buying </span><b>online</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> tends to be cheaper, but you often don’t get as much information and support. With </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, an online representative is available to chat and answer all your questions. This way, you can get a great price without leaving the uncomfort of your own bed in search of a new one. </span></p>
