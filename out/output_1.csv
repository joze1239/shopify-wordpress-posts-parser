Discover our 10 favorite hacks to rejuvenate your mornings below!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<b>1. Keep your alarm out of reach </b><br>
<ol></ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Put your alarm or phone far from your bed. This will force you to physically get out of bed to turn it off and </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">stay awake.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> It will also make you less likely to hit the snooze button </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and fall back to sleep</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. With the</span><a href=""https://www.eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Eight Sleep Pod</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, you can set the thermal alarm to start cooling your bed toward wake up time, waking you up energized and refreshed. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>2. Make your bed </b></p>
<ol start=""2""></ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you want to feel more productive in the morning, the easiest thing to do is make your bed. It may seem like a small task, but starting your day by making your bed gives you a </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">feeling </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">of accomplishment. This will set you up for success for the rest of the day. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And, as an added bonus, making your bed will make it that much cozier to lay down on after a long day at work.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>3. Do the shower trick</b></p>
<ol start=""3""></ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There's a </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/the-90-second-energy-hack-you-need-to-try""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">90-second trick</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that you do to boost your energy in the mornings. At the end of your shower, simply blast yourself with cold water for 30 seconds, followed by hot water for 30 seconds, and then finish with cold water for a final 30 seconds. The rapid change in temperature will increase blood flow and stimulate the body and mind. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>4. Fatten up your coffee</b></p>
<ol start=""4""></ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Instead of relying on that third cup of coffee, or that extra shot of espresso, consider adding healthy fats to your morning cup of coffee to give yourself a boost. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you depend on coffee to function, mix your coffee with 2 teaspoons of coconut oil or butter. Adding healthy fats to your coffee will make the caffeine metabolize slowly and work throughout the day. As a result, you'll stay alert for longer. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<b>5. Exercise </b><br>
<ol start=""5""></ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It may sound like a daunting task in the early hours of the day, but </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">exercising in the morning is the best way to wake yourself up. Working out boosts endorphins, which gives you more energy and puts you in a better mood. You'll also jumpstart your metabolism and burn more calories. Not only will you feel more energized, but you'll be healthier too. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<b>6. Drink a lemon elixir </b><br>
<ol start=""6""></ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are several health benefits to drinking warm lemon water in the morning. First, it flushes out toxins and aids the digestive system. Second, lemon is rich in nutrients like calcium, potassium, and vitamin C. Most importantly, it hydrates and oxygenates the body. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<b>7. Eat a banana</b><br>
<ol start=""7""></ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bananas are an excellent morning staple because the fruit's combination of complex carbs, natural sugar, amino acids, and brain-boosting vitamins will give you a quick energy boost. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Perfect to eat by itself or add to your breakfast.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<b>8. Jam out </b><br>
<ol start=""8""></ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Play upbeat music as you're getting ready or commuting to work. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Decide on a playlist or choose a list of songs that make you feel lively and excited. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The energizing tunes will pump you up and </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">make </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">you </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">feel ready for </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the day.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<b>9. Get some sunlight</b><br>
<ol start=""9""></ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Light, especially bright light from the sun, signals the body that it's time to wake up. As soon as you get up, open your blinds and let in the natural light</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to start feeling less fatigue.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<b>10. Smell essential oils </b><br>
<ol start=""10""></ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Aromatherapy can significantly reduce your grogginess. Peppermint and eucalyptus scents can make you feel more alert, focused, and stimulated in the morning. The smell of rosemary can jumpstart your brain, giving you more mental and physical energy. Citrus can reduce stress and boost the body's production of serotonin. In fact, </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16095639""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">studies</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> have shown that sniffing the skin of an orange can increase alertness and reduce anxiety. </span> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you dread waking up each morning, remember that you have the opportunity to set yourself up for success by just adding a few extra steps to your morning routine. There are so many alternatives to turn to when you find yourself needing a push in those early hours of the day. And, believe it or not, these added steps might prove to be more helpful than that extra shot (or two) of espresso.</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So, what are you waiting for? Follow these 10 hacks to help you feel energized and rejuvenated every morning. Begin by conquering one morning, and pretty soon you will be able to conquer them all.</span></p>",,2/21/2018 17:13,hacks-that-will-make-you-feel-energized-in-the-morning,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-516827198.jpg?v=1519252548,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
"You Can Learn How To Wake Up Without An Alarm, Here's How",6931906600,"<p>Waking up is hard, and waking up without an alarm can be even harder for some. Nobody likes to be jolted awake from a loud, ringing noise, but many of us depend on our alarms to get us up in the morning. What if we told you there's a way to train yourself to wake up without a jarring alarm? The key to doing this is training your body and circadian rhythm to adjust to the morning naturally.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency is key </strong></p>
<p>To stop using an alarm, you need to maintain a consistent sleep schedule. This means going to bed and waking up at the same time everyday. Following a specific schedule will set and regulate your internal body clock. You can start by waking up every morning at 7 AM using an alarm. Your body will gradually adjust to this time and you'll soon find yourself waking up on your own, before your alarm.</p>
<p><strong>Establish rituals</strong></p>
<p>To help you stick to a sleep-wake routine, we suggest creating a bedtime ritual that gets you ready for sleep and forming morning habits that get you excited about waking up. Your pre-bed routine should promote good sleep hygiene. About an hour before bed, dim the lights and switch your phone to night mode. You can also practice relaxation techniques like meditation or a warm bath to destress and wind down. Since we're talking about waking up, the morning routine is most important. Have you ever noticed how easy it is to wake up on the morning of a vacation or big event you're looking forward to? This is because your brain knows that you need to be energized. The best way to trick your brain into thinking this all the time, is to schedule exciting things to do in the morning. Go for a run, sign up for your favorite yoga class, or make a delicious smoothie. If you do something fun or active every morning, you'll start to get used to waking up early. </p>
<p><strong>Open your blinds</strong></p>
<p>The sun is your natural alarm clock, so use it to your advantage. Open your blinds a crack to let the sun in. Light plays a huge role in our circadian and signals the brain that it's time to get up. </p>
<p><strong>Set one just in case </strong></p>
<p>﻿If you're afraid of sleeping in, set an alarm as a backup. It's always better to be safe than sorry (or in this case - late). Our favorite type of alarm to use is a smart alarm because it wakes you up in your lightest stage of sleep. If you set your alarm at 7 AM, it may go off up to 30 minutes earlier depending on your sleep cycle. You'll feel better waking up with the smart alarm because you won't feel groggy. This way, you'll have more energy to go about your day. </p>",,2/21/2018 13:23,how-to-wake-up-without-an-alarm,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-593300380.jpg?v=1519247467,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
How To Get Deeper Sleep,6916571176,"<p>We all want to sleep better, but there's one part of sleep that's even more crucial to our overall health - deep sleep. </p>
<p>Deep sleep is the elusive stage of sleep when your brain waves are at their lowest frequency, your muscles relax, and your breathing slows. Also known as delta wave sleep, it comes at the end of NREM sleep. Deep sleep is so important because it's the most restorative part of the night. During this time, energy levels recharge, body tissues are repaired, muscles receive more blood supply, and the pituitary gland releases human growth hormone. Basically, you need deep sleep to maintain, repair, and rejuvenate your body and brain. </p>
<p>The <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/the-difference-between-light-and-deep-sleep-how-much-do-you-really-need"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">amount of deep sleep</a> you need varies with age, but spending at least 20% of the night in deep sleep is a good goal.  When a person is in deep sleep, they barely move and are difficult to wake up. Sleepers in deep sleep are less apt to wake in response to external stimuli and won't be disrupted during their slumber. If you get more deep sleep, you'll toss and turn less and likely feel more well-rested in the morning. </p>
<p>Since this stage of sleep is so mysterious, there is little research on how to get deeper sleep. However, the best way to get more deep sleep is to sleep better and more soundly. Here are some ways you can set your sleep up for success. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1. Regulate Bedroom Temperature </strong></p>
<p>If you're too hot or too cold during the night, you'll probably have difficulty falling or staying asleep. This will cause you to toss and turn a lot and may interrupt your deep sleep. The ideal bedroom temperature for optimal sleep is 60-67 degrees. A cooler bedroom will facilitate sleep by lowering the body temperature, which happens at the onset of sleep. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2. Eliminate Distractions </strong></p>
<p>Another reason for restlessness is external distractions like noise and light. Keep your phone on silent and away from your bed to avoid being awoken by notifications. In addition, you should try to sleep in a dark room. Blackout shades will help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. If it's noisy outside your bedroom window, try listening to relaxing sounds or using a white noise machine during the night to offset those loud noises.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3. Avoid Alcohol Or Caffeine </strong></p>
<p>The number one reason for tossing and turning at night is alcohol or caffeine. Drinking booze or coffee close to bedtime messes with your sleep. Caffeine may keep you up at night while alcohol will disrupt your slumber. As the alcohol wears off during the second part of the night, people usually wake up and deep sleep is cut short. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3. Get Comfy </strong></p>
<p>Being comfortable is the best way to have a good, full night's sleep. There are a number of ways to get comfy at night, but we recommend finding a mattress you love first. The <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">right mattress</a> will do wonders for your sleep. </p>

Eight Is One Of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies,6906511400,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For the past 11 years, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fast Company </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">has reviewed thousands of companies to determine the world’s most innovative. This year, Eight landed in Top 10 for </span><a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2018/sectors/consumer-electronics""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Consumer Electronics</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. We were one of the 28 companies to appear on the list for the first time, ranking among list veterans like Apple, Amazon, and Sony. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We are honored to be recognized as a leading company in technology and innovation. Since our founding in 2014, we’ve been focusing on evolving and improving the way we sleep. Eight is bringing the biggest technological advancement that sleep has seen in the past 300 years.  For centuries, humans have been sleeping the same. By leveraging technology like we have done for all other aspects of our lives, we can change the way we sleep for the better. At Eight, we are driven by the belief that sleep can be engineered to perfection. We spent years of R&amp;D and tested over 10 million hours of sleep to develop the first smart mattress that maximizes sleep quality. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/pages/mattress-collections""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight Smart Mattress</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> seamlessly monitors 15 factors of sleep and health while also adjusting your environment to optimize for better rest. We launched the first edition in early 2016 and added two more models eight months later. Now there are over 20,000 people sleeping soundly on an Eight Smart Mattress. Based on our current growth track, we are en route to building the largest sleep database in the world. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Using all the data collected from our sophisticated technology, we can extract information about sleep and discover new things that have yet to be discovered in the field of sleep research. Our advanced sensor technology can help us learn about our bodies and health to improve our sleep and wake routines. By leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence, we’ll soon be able to identify how many hours each individual really needs to achieve maximum recovery and rest and the environmental conditions that are conducive to it. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Consumer devices like Eight are revolutionizing the way we think about our health in terms of exercise, nutrition, and sleep. Understanding your habits will help you make effective lifestyle changes that will ultimately make you a better version of yourself. This is why we created the Eight Smart Mattress. We are on a mission to make people’s lives happier and healthier through great sleep. </span></p>",,2/20/2018 9:49,eight-is-one-of-fast-company-s-most-innovative-companies,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/MIC_Twitter_FB_card.png?v=1519138145,,open,open,Uncategorized,Product
Does Sharing A Bed Affect Your Sleep?,6795722792,"<p>With almost 60% of Eight users sharing a bed, it's no wonder our smart mattresses were designed with couples in mind. Despite what some of us may think, sharing a bed with a partner does not cause significant sleep disturbances. Although some people may wake up due to snoring or a partner's toss and turns, the reality is that sleeping next to someone isn't a factor in bad sleep. Our data found that those who shared a bed had almost the same sleep score as those who slept alone. In fact, people who shared a bed had a slightly higher average score (71.24) than solo sleepers (70.48). </p>
<p>If your partner is disrupting your sleep quality, there are two easy ways to resolve the issue (without kicking him or her to the couch): </p>
<p><strong>1. Upgrade your mattress</strong> </p>
<p>You need a foam mattress that minimizes motion transfer. This way you won't feel your partner move as he or she switches sleep positions. </p>
<p><strong>2. Check the temperature </strong></p>
<p>It can be tough to agree on the perfect bed temperature. The Eight Smart Mattress solves the biggest issue when sharing a bed by offering dual-zone temperature control. One person can warm up their bed while the other can keep it as is. In addition, it's important to set your bedroom thermostat to a cool temperature of 60-67 degrees. This is the ideal temperature for good sleep. </p>
<p>Some sleep experts are now saying the sharing the bed with someone improves sleep quality. A <a href=""https://jezebel.com/5915750/the-benefits-of-sharing-your-bed"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">2009 study</a> found that women in long-term stable relationships fell asleep quicker and woke up less during the night compared to single women. The researchers also hypothesized that shared sleep in healthy relationships may lower levels of cortisol, a stress hormone and boost oxytocin, the love-hormone that eases anxiety. If you share a bed, it's also recommended to have sex right before bed - it may be the key to a good night's sleep. Oxytocin, which is released during an orgasm, <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dream-catcher/201108/oxytocin-sleep-and-dreams"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">influences</a> sleep processes and dreams. </p>
<p>If you're single, don't fret! Good sleep is still possible for you. Many people still find sharing a bed too be annoying and uncomfortable. In a survey by the University of Leeds and Silentnight, 29% of people said their partner was an obstacle to their sleep. And poor sleep could hurt everything -- from your mood to your weight. Likewise, 60% of couples polled by <em>The Today Show </em><a href=""https://www.today.com/health/defense-sleeping-solo-60-percent-you-prefer-your-own-bed-6C10885410?utm_source=huffingtonpost.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=pubexchange"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">reported</a> sleeping better alone. </p>
<p>Since there seems to be data supporting single sleepers and couples, it's really up to you. Both types of sleeping are great, as long as you are comfortable. </p>

This Sleep Hack Will Knock You Out In Just 60 Seconds,6716489768,"<p>No matter how tired we feel, we've all had that one night where we just can't fall asleep. The reasons why we occasionally struggle to fall asleep vary - from too much coffee during the day to anxiety and stress. </p>
<p>In order to fall asleep quickly, you need to be in the right state of mind and body. This means calm and controlled breaths as well as a clear mind. Simple breathing exercises can combat anxiety and help with insomnia. Harvard trained doctor, Andrew Weil, believes the <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3067526/Can-t-sleep-4-7-8-breathing-technique-claims-help-nod-60-SECONDS.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">4-7-8 trick</a> will help you fall asleep in 60 seconds. That's right - 60 SECONDS! </p>
<p><strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong></p>
<p>The method is described as a natural tranquilizer that reduces tension in the body and promotes relaxation. For it to work, you need to breathe in counts of 4, 7, and 8. Doing so, your lungs and brain will properly fill with oxygen, which helps catalyze a good night's sleep. </p>
<p><strong>HOW YOU DO IT</strong></p>
<p>1. Exhale completely through your mouth making a 'whoosh' sound</p>
<p>2. Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds</p>
<p>3. Hold your breath for 7 seconds</p>
<p>4. Exhale through your mouth for 8 seconds, making another 'whoosh' sound </p>
<p>5. Repeat 3 times </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlDSsHuxLM97yso/giphy.gif"" alt=""""></p>
<p>The technique is based on an ancient Indian practice called pranayama, which means ""regulation of breath."" If it doesn't work at first, don't worry! It will take a some time to master the rhythm. It also helps to not focus too much on the end goal. If you put too much pressure on yourself to fall asleep fast, your mind will be unable to relax. </p>

<p>Smart lights are a great investment because your sleep cycle is dictated by light. With these Philips Hue lights, you can create a setting that mimics the sunset and gradually dims down as you drift off to sleep. You can also switch your lights to a relaxing orange color at night to signal your brain that it's time to wind down. In the morning, you can trigger a wake up light which will naturally wake you up with lights. </p>
<p>4. <a href=""https://www.calm.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Calm </a></p>
<p>Calm is an app focused on mindfulness and meditation, both of which will help you sleep better. Doing a little bit of guided meditation at night can calm anxiety and promote deep sleep. It's especially great for people who often have trouble falling asleep. </p>

<p>Snoring can interrupt sleep and cause a lot of problems when sharing a bed. Smart Nora is a revolutionary product that detects snoring throughout the night. You insert into your pillow and it will gently adjust your pillow when you start snoring. This will stimulate the throat muscles, allowing for natural breathing to resume. It'll help the snorer and the partner sleep soundly during the night. </p>
<p>7. <a href=""https://nest.com/thermostats/nest-learning-thermostat/overview/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Nest Thermostat</a> </p>
<p>One of the major causes of toss and turns at night is improper bedroom temperature. The ideal temperature for optimal sleep is 60-67 degrees Fahrenheit. Keeping the room too hot or too cold can disrupt sleep. A smart thermostat like Nest will help you regulate your bedroom so it stays at the perfect sleep-inducing temperature. </p>

<p>Aromatherapy shouldn't be overlooked when trying to sleep better. Placing an essential oil diffuser in your bedroom is a great solution for sinus congestion, insomnia, or stress. We like the lavender scent because it relaxes the body and calms the mind. Using it 30 minutes before bed may help you drift off faster. </p>

How To Make Up For A Bad Night Of Sleep,6459686952,"<p>We've all struggled with a bad night of sleep before. Tossing and turning all night can leave us feeling seriously lethargic and anxious the next day. However, a sleepless night doesn't have to set you off track. You'll be surprised at how well you can function if you use these strategies to power through your day. </p>
<p><strong>1. Stay optimistic</strong> </p>
<p>Don't underestimate human resilience. One night of poor sleep isn't catastrophic. If you keep the right attitude, you may find your focus and energy levels are consistent with your normal days. Working yourself up over a rough night will just drain your energy more. It's important not to stress about your night because obsessing over not sleeping can lead to more trouble sleeping the next night. </p>
<p><strong>2. Take it easy </strong></p>
<p>With your energy already compromised, it makes sense to take it easy the next day. Skip your planned evening workout, and spend your night unwinding before bed. If you don't get enough sleep, your workouts will be significantly less effective. Restorative sleep is needed to repair and build muscle tissues. Gentle exercise is fine, but don't exert yourself too much. Try doing some yoga or light exercise in the morning to promote blood circulation and increase alertness. </p>
<p><strong>3. Let there be light </strong></p>
<p>Get exposed to as much bright light as possible, especially right after waking up. Morning light energizes us and improves mood by boosting serotonin levels. It also helps regulate our circadian rhythm, which will contribute to better sleep in the future. When there's little or no sunlight in the AM, use <a href=""https://medium.com/@mf_95086/how-i-use-light-to-hack-my-energy-f1670e48dd55"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">artificial light</a> during the daytime. </p>
<p><strong>4. Stick to a healthy diet </strong></p>
<p>Even though you'll be tempted to reach for a sweet pastry and coffee in the morning, sugar and caffeine will only provide a short fix. You should also avoid large meals and simple carbohydrates like pasta for lunch. These foods will make you more likely to crash later on. Try eating protein-rich foods like nuts and lean meats to keep you energy levels up. Remember to stay hydrated and drink a lot of water during the day as well. </p>
<p><strong>5. Go outside</strong></p>
<p>Tiredness peaks from 1 pm - 3 pm. If you can't squeeze in a 20-minute power nap during this time, get some fresh air. <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494409000838"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Research</a> shows that spending time outside increases energy in 90% of people. </p>
<p>Sleepless nights happen to the best of us, but we can overcome their negative effects. Remember, it's just one day we have to get through. Bed is only a few hours away. Go to sleep slightly earlier the following night and you'll feel totally rejuvenated the next day. </p>
<p> </p>",,1/31/2018 15:14,how-to-make-up-for-a-bad-night-of-sleep,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-508857742.jpg?v=1517430970,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
8 Easy Ways To Sleep Better,6427967528,"<p>We spend at least a third of our lives sleeping, so it's important we make our sleep count. A good night's sleep is just as important as a healthy diet and regular exercise in maintaining good health. Several studies show that poor sleep can negatively effect the brain and body from impaired memory and cognitive function to increased risk of heart disease or weight gain. </p>
<p>If you want to lead a healthy life, quality sleep should be made a priority. Since everyone sleeps, it shouldn't be that hard to sleep well. Here are 8 evidence-based tips to sleep better at night. </p>
<p><strong>1. Go into night mode</strong></p>
<p>Light, especially the harsh blue light emitted from screens, can disrupt sleep. Put your devices in night mode and try to limit your use of phones, tablets, and laptops in the evening. The blue light impacts your circadian rhythm by stimulating the brain and tricking the brain into thinking it's still daytime. </p>
<p><strong>2. Unwind before bed</strong></p>
<p>Many people have trouble falling asleep when they have a lot on their minds. Stress and anxiety will keep you up at night, so it's important to unwind before bed. Do some breathing or meditation exercises to calm you down. You should try and stop working at 30 minutes to an hour before going to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>3. Write everything down</strong></p>
<p>If you are worrying about work, remove those thoughts from your head by writing them down. According to <a href=""http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-47677-001"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">research from Baylor University</a>, people who wrote down their to-do lists fro the next day were able to fall asleep faster. </p>
<p><strong>4. Optimize your bedroom environment</strong></p>
<p>In order to get the best sleep of your life, you need to create an ideal bedroom environment. Your bedroom should be quiet, dark, and organized to get a good night's sleep. Noise, external lights, and clutter have all been shown to affect sleep quality. One <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21243655"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">study</a> found that around 50% of participants noticed better sleep when reductions in noise and lighting were introduced.  </p>
<p><strong>5. Keep your bedroom cool </strong></p>
<p>One of the primary reasons for tossing and turning at night is temperature regulation. The idea temperature of sleep is fairly cool, between <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8022726?ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">60-68 degrees</a>. Temperatures in this range help facilitate the decrease in core body temperature that initiates sleepiness. </p>
<p><strong>6. Exercise regularly </strong></p>
<p>For those who have trouble falling asleep, your solution may be found at the gym. Regular exercise during the day is a great way to ensure a good night's sleep. One <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8980207"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">study</a> found that exercise nearly halved the amount of time it took to fall asleep and helped participants sleep 41 minutes longer at night. </p>
<p><strong>7. Keep a consistent schedule </strong></p>
<p>This is one of the most important rules to follow if you want to sleep better. Waking up at the same time everyday, even on weekends, will synchronize your circadian rhythm and help you wake up feeling refreshed and well-rested. Maintaining a regular schedule, specifically wake up time, will ensure that all the proper hormones are being released at the right time. </p>
<p><strong>8. Get a comfortable mattress</strong></p>
<p>Comfort is key when sleeping, and the right mattress can do wonders for you! You need a mattress that will provide the perfect amount of support for you back and neck. <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/pages/mattress-collections"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Eight Smart Mattress</a> was designed to align the neck and spine and cradle the body in all the right places. Remember that mattresses sag with time, so if you've had your mattress for more than 8 years - it's time for an upgrade. </p>",,1/29/2018 14:27,8-easy-ways-to-sleep-better,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-599959942.jpg?v=1517256435,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle

Eight’s Guide To Personal Productivity,5946572840,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400; color: #000000;"">Here at Eight, we’re a small team with big plans for the future. In order to optimize sleep, we need to maximize our productivity. This means we need to be efficient, effective, and ambitious when setting and achieving our goals. As a startup, we need to move fast and execute well. We’ve grown exponentially in the past year, and can attest our growth to our hard working team at Eight HQ.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At Eight, we believe good sleep is a mean to better health, happiness, energy, and productivity. Today’s post is going to focus on the latter. These are our 5 favorite tips for increasing workplace productivity.</span><b></b></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>1. The Two Priority Rule</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400; color: #000000;"">This rule was invented by the CEO of Eight, Matteo Franceschetti, and we all use it in our daily work routine. The right way to prioritize is to work on only 2 tasks, projects, or goals per day. Once you understand what’s most important, focus only on that. Don’t get distracted with smaller tasks and learn how to say no to requests. The way you choose these priorities is by determining which ones will bring the most improvement and value to the company. You shouldn’t try to do more than two, because a third is not manageable. Peter Thiel is famous for pushing each of his team members to focus only on one priority at a time. Matteo believes we can stretch that to two.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> </span></p>
<div><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>2. Follow A Schedule</strong></span></div>
<div><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong></strong></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style=""color: #000000;"">In order to be productive, you need to be organized. Following a schedule is the best way to stay on top of all the things you need to do. At Eight, we use Google Calendar to keep track of meetings, deadlines, and reminders. Many of us also block off a chunk of time for a specific task. Our Growth Lead does market research every Friday from 3-5 PM. Our Social Media Manager monitors Facebook notifications every morning at 11 AM. And our Engineering Team plans weekly sprints every Tuesday at 10:30 AM. Having these tasks on the calendar helps us maintain focus throughout the workweek. Following a schedule is important in all aspects of life, not just work. The world’s best CEOs claim a consistent schedule is the key to success. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day will leave you feeling refreshed each day, even on Monday mornings. Forming a daily routine will help you maximize your waking hours, develop discipline, and make you feel better.</span></div>

<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><b>3. Make To-Do Lists</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400; color: #000000;"">You can’t be productive without making to-do lists. Create a daily or weekly to-do list and check the list every day to make sure you’re doing everything you need to be doing. And remember, you don’t need to have a million things on your to-do list. Keep it simple and prioritize your tasks. Try to be strategic about your energy. Don’t waste energy on small, menial tasks. Apply your energy to the two most important tasks that move your business forward. Also, be cognizant as to when you write these to-do lists. Alexandra Zatarain, Co-Founder and CMO of Eight, writes out her list every Sunday afternoon. She says writing it out on Sunday reduces the stress and anxiety of Monday morning. It also helps start the day with clarity. You’ll know exactly which item you need to complete by 10 AM the next morning.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>4. Manage Your Time</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">A highly-efficient way to manage time is to make a chart based on urgency and importance. This is called the time management matrix, and it’s divided into four sections (Important + Urgent, Important + Not Urgent, Not Important + Urgent, Not Important + Not Urgent). The idea is to focus on quadrant 2. This is where you’ll add the most value to your company. It requires more high-level thinking and strategizing.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><img src=""//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/Screen_Shot_2017-12-22_at_12.12.31_PM_grande.png?v=1513968549"" alt="""" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400; color: #000000;""><b>5. Sleep Well</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Last but certainly not least, pay attention to your sleep. Insufficient sleep can compromise output and hold you back professionally, resulting in reduced efficiency and overall poor productivity. When you don’t sleep enough, you’ll get distracted more easily, you’ll make more mistakes, and your memory will falter. A </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21886353"" style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Harvard research study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> found that, for the average worker, insomnia leads to the loss of 11.3 days’ worth of productivity each calendar year. In order to get better sleep and perform at your best, you need to identify a healthy sleep routine. This means first creating an ideal sleeping environment - </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/pages/mattress-collections"" style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">quality mattress</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, cool bedroom temperature, and little to night. Once your environment is conducive for sleep, try to go to bed earlier and limit the use of electronics at night. Finally, don’t forget to wake up at the same time every morning - even on weekends. This will keep you well-rested and energized throughout the work week.</span></span></p>

The 90-Second Energy Hack You Need To Try,5697110056,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you struggle to wake up in the morning, keep on reading.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/iTGBDC1B0MQ"" frameborder=""0"" gesture=""media"" allow=""encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen=""""></iframe></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Instead of hitting snooze, hop in the shower. But this isn’t your normal morning shower. When we take hot showers (as most of us do), our body temperature rises. An increase in body temperature actually creates a bedtime effect, relaxing the body and preparing it for sleep. Luckily, there’s a 90-second trick that you can do to reverse this effect. At the end of your shower, simply blast yourself with cold water for 30 seconds, followed by hot water for 30 seconds, and then finish with cold water for a final 30 seconds. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The rapid change in temperature will open up the capillaries, increase blood flow, and stimulate the body and mind. Experts believe this hack can boost your energy and keep you alert all day long. Our Founder &amp; CEO, <strong>Matteo Franceschetti</strong>, does it every day and swears by it.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""I started doing it a few months ago, and it's now part of my morning routine. The switch from hot to cold helps me feel more energized the minute I step out of the shower. </span></em><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It's so easy to do and you'll feel the effects immediately. Since I exercise in the morning, this cold water hack also helps my muscles recover. It's a win-win for me. </span></em><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you combine this with the <a href=""https://medium.com/@mf_95086/all-you-need-is-8-minutes-to-feel-more-energized-in-the-morning-31c23389094b"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">8 minute work out</a> before showering, benefits will be even more substantial."" </span></em></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""If you have a chance, I notice that having a sauna in the morning after working out and then taking the cold shower will help you even more. The key thing is expose the body to temperature shocks.""</span></em></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This shower technique is just a DIY-version of hot and cold hydrotherapy, which has been used for thousands of years for its natural healing and stress-relieving powers. Alternating between hot and cold temperatures increases blood circulation and detoxes the body. There are several benefits to taking cold showers, and we have scientific research to prove it.</span></p>
<p><b>Reduces stress </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A </span><a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0891584994900302""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> found that those who regularly swim in cold water were able to adapt and tolerate stress. The shock of the cold water hardens the body overtime and helps it respond healthily to stressful situations.</span></p>
<p><b>Strengthens immune system</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17999770""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> found that taking daily cold showers increases the number of disease-fighting white blood cells. In order to warm up, the body speeds up its metabolic rate, thus activating the immune system. A </span><a href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161749""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">2016 study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> also found that hot-to-cold showering reduced the amount of times people stayed home sick. Say hello to health!</span></p>
<p><b>Improves blood circulation </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When exposed to cold water, your arteries and veins constrict. This temporary tightening allows blood to flow at a higher pressure, which is great for cardiovascular health. The increased blood circulation decreases inflammation and swelling, which is why professional athletes use ice baths to help their muscles recover after a workout. </span></p>
<p><b>Burns fat</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Scientists have found that shivering from cold showers triggers the production of </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19357407""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">brown fat</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, which works to keep you warm by burning calories.</span></p>
<p><b>Battles depression </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cold showers could be a potential treatment for depression. </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17993252""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> found that exposure to cold activates the sympathetic nervous system and increases endorphins, which cold produce an anti-depressive effect. </span></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Although cold showers aren’t the most enjoyable, they reap so many positive benefits. And we’re not asking you to take an entirely cold shower. All you need is a few seconds of cold at the end. Remember, it’s 30 seconds of cold - 30 seconds of hot - 30 seconds of cold. Try it out for a week, and see how energized you feel during the day.</p>

Is The Food Coma Real?,5367889960,"<p>Well, kind of. </p>
<p>But your Thanksgiving turkey isn't the only food to blame for your post-dinner nap. An ongoing myth is that the tryptophan in turkey is what makes you sleepy. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid needed for the body to produce serotonin. And serotonin is used to make melatonin, which is the hormone that helps you sleep. Although turkey and sleep are somewhat connected, the bird does not contain enough tryptophan to induce sleep, and it actually has <a href=""http://www.newswise.com/articles/the-myth-about-l-trypophan-in-turkey"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">less tryptophan</a> than other poultry like chicken or even eggs. </p>
<p>The ""food coma"" we experience after Thanksgiving is likely due to the large quantities of food consumed in general. That includes turkey, but also stuffing, mashed potatoes, booze, and pie. In 2016, our Eight users slept 29 more minutes than average after Thanksgiving. This year, we only slept 9 more minutes than usual, averaging at 6 hours at 31 minutes. We also got 19.5% of deep sleep, which is in the healthy range. </p>
<p>People tend to overindulge during the holidays, and a typical Thanksgiving plate can be well over 2,000 calories. High-carb, high-fat, and high-sugar foods (like sweet potato casserole or pumpkin pie) trigger a neural response that tells the body to slow down. Furthermore, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15488646"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">researchers</a> found that a group of brain cells called orexin neurons are very sensitive to glucose levels, which spike after a big meal. Those neurons produce a protein, orexin, which moderates wakefulness. </p>
<p>As the quantity of food increases, so does the amount of insulin released during digestion. Insulin then increases the amount of serotonin and melatonin in the body, which are the two primary chemicals associated with drowsiness. </p>
<p>The best way to avoid the Thanksgiving food coma is to eat earlier (around 5 PM), have a healthy breakfast on Thursday morning, and control your portion size. Remember, there's always room for leftovers! </p>

How To Reboot Your Sleep Cycle,241958915,"<p>We all know how important a good night's sleep is for our well-being, but sometimes life gets in the way. Sleeping in on the weekends, work, stress, and traveling can impact our sleep cycle and throw it off its normal rhythm. Going days or weeks without a consistent sleep schedule can be detrimental to your health. When your circadian rhythm is out of sync, you may find it difficult to fall asleep and wake up at the right times. But like any clock, your circadian clock can be reset as well. </p>
<meta charset=""utf-8""><meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p><strong>Here's a guide on how to fix your sleep schedule following a time change:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><img alt="""" src=""//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/TimeChnage_1024x1024.jpg?v=1509741863"" style=""float: none;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p>Following the guide above is one way to fix your sleep schedule. In fact, it can take 3 days up to one week to adjust to a new time. Beside changing your sleep and wake times slightly, you can also try these tips. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1. Turn on the lights</strong></p>
<p>Your biological clock is mainly controlled by the daily cycles of lightness and darkness, and manipulating light exposure may help reset your clock. Turn on the lights right when you wake up. This is super helpful in the fall and winter because it's typically still dark in the mornings. We recommend syncing your Phillips Hue to your alarm so you wake up with sunrise simulating lights. You should start dimming the lights as the sun sets, and try to keep your bedroom as dark as possible. This means lights from screens should be reduced or fully eliminated. </p>
<p><strong>2. Fast for 12-16 hours</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://sleep.med.harvard.edu/news/229/Harvard+study+finds+fasting+resets+circadian+clock"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Research from Harvard</a> suggested that not eating for about 12-16 hours can quickly reboot the sleep-wake cycle. This is because our bodies also run on a ""food clock,"" which takes over when we are hungry. If you are a jet lag, this technique is extremely effective. By fasting for 12-16 hours, you can trick your body that it's time to sleep. When you break the fast, your body will think it's morning. For non-jetlag disturbances, you could still try this fast. Eat an early dinner (around 4 PM), and then avoid eating until breakfast (8 AM). Once your sleep is back on schedule, stick to normal meal times. </p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p><strong>3. Stay consistent </strong></p>
<p>A consistent sleep schedule is the best way to achieve a good night's sleep. This means you need to go to sleep and wake up at the same time everyday, including weekends. When you sleep in on Saturday and Sunday, it'll be much harder to wake up for work on Monday. Waking up late on the weekend produces something called ""social jet lag"" and is associated with poorer health, worse mood, and fatigue. </p>

A healthy sleep schedule is the first step. </p>",,11/2/2017 12:14,how-to-reboot-your-sleep-cycle,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-490474430.jpg?v=1509641664,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
The Most Common Nightmares In The USA,227082243,"<p>Have you ever dreamed that you were falling and jolted awake right before you were about to hit the ground? Probably. </p>
<p>Turns out, falling is the most common element in dreams. Since falling dreams produce an uneasy feeling, we're going to say it's a nightmare. Nightmares are bad dreams that awake you from deep sleep. They occur most often during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and could be explained as the unconscious manifestation of your everyday fears and anxieties. Although dream analysis is subjective, many people believe falling indicates a loss of control. When people feel overwhelmed in their lives, they may experience nightmares about falling. We surveyed 1,000 Eight users and found that 42% of them have had a falling nightmare. The second most common nightmare amongst Eight users was being attacked at 41% followed by being trapped (34%), death (32%), showing up late to work (29%). </p>
<p>Our survey also supported a <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090128104535.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">2009 study</a> showing that women are more likely to report having nightmares than their male counterparts. We found that women recall their dreams upon awakening 17x more often than men. Women also admitted to having infidelity nightmares, and had them 38x more often than men. Since women tend to pay more attention to their feelings, they are more likely to carry their feelings into bed and subsequently dream about them. Whether women experience nightmares more than men or just report them more frequently is yet to be determined. </p>
<p>Although nightmares can be scary, they didn't seem to affect the quality of one's sleep. Sleep scores remained fairly consistent between those who recall their nightmares and those who do not. </p>

Can Sleep Trackers Help Us Live Healthier?,172793539,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We all want to be healthy; that’s why we track everything from our calories to our steps. But sleep is an important part of living healthy as well, and sleep tracking can help further improve our health when combined with an active lifestyle.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What sleep trackers can tell you about your health: </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-if you’re sleeping too much or too little</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-if you have health issues that interrupt your sleep</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-can help determine why you feel fatigue or exhaustion during the day</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-how your daily activities affect sleep</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-if you're at an increased risk for heart disease and/or depression</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Living healthy requires being aware of the importance of your sleep, and sleep trackers show you the quality of your sleep in detail, from how many hours you sleep nightly to your respiratory and heart rate.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleep deprivation can literally </span><a href=""https://hbr.org/2011/03/sleep-is-more-important-than-f""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">kill you, and it can do so faster than food deprivation</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Many people do not realize they are not getting enough sleep, but a sleep tracker reveals a severe lack of sleep before it turns into a major health issue. Tracking your sleep can tell you how long it takes you to fall asleep each night. If it takes you a mere few minutes every night, you are likely sleep deprived. A lack of sleep has also been found to weaken your immune system and lead to depression. You can use the information from sleep tracking to help avoid health problems and improve your sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Conversely, oversleeping is also a health issue that sleep tracking can detect. Regularly sleeping for more than 9 hours each night poses health risks just like sleep deprivation does, such as a </span><a href=""https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/guide/physical-side-effects-oversleeping#1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">higher risk of heart disease and depression</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. A sleep tracker can detect oversleeping so you can seek help from a sleep professional and live healthy.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleep tracking can also help to detect other sleep issues like sleep apnea. By using a sleep tracker, you can talk to a doctor and seek treatment sooner.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Furthermore, poor sleep leads to an inability to fully concentrate on tasks during the day. No one wants to mess up that work presentation or fail that final exam. More importantly, a good night’s rest gives us the energy we need to exercise during the day, another key element to overall health.  Not sure the cause behind your poor sleep? Sleep trackers like the </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/eight-sleep-tracker?variant=34186577923""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight bed technology</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> can help determine possible reasons behind a lack of or interrupted sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Eight app connects your waking hours with those spent asleep so you can see how activities like drinking caffeine or exercising before bed affect your sleep and make any necessary changes.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">From telling us the right amount of sleep we need each night to detecting sleep issues, sleep trackers can provide us the information needed to help us live our healthiest and most well rested lives. So start sleep tracking today!</span></p>",,10/25/2017 19:23,can-sleep-trackers-help-us-live-healthier,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/health.jpeg?v=1508973818,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle

Check out the descriptions and pros and cons of each below to find the best fit for you.</span></p>
<h2><b>Apps</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are a number of sleep tracking apps out there. Sleep Cycle is one such sleep app that is highly rated by users. You place your phone very near or in your bed, and turn on the app to track your sleep.</span></p>

</ul>
<h2><b>Non-wearables</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Non-wearable sleep trackers like </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/eight-sleep-tracker""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> have many benefits. A smart mattress pad fits over any mattress to track your sleep. The bed technology consists of piezo sensors that provide accurate, detailed sleep data. Unlike other sleep trackers, Eight offers many connected features beyond simply tracking your sleep to improve the sleep experience.</span></p>
<p><strong>Pros: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Don’t have to wear or charge anything</span></li>

<h2><b>Wearables </b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wearable sleep trackers like the highly rated Fitbit serve as more than just a sleep tracker. </span></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Relatively affordable </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tracks sleep as well as your steps,activities, etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Only tracks your individual sleep </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not very accurate since it mainly detects arm movement versus non-wearables which track entire body movement</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Must be worn all the time. And who wants that tan line? </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Needs to be charged </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Uncomfortable to wear to bed </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You have to remember to set it to sleep mode every night</span></li>

What The End Of Daylight Savings Means For Sleep,172764227,"<p>Even though we gain an extra hour of sleep this weekend, it doesn't necessarily mean we'll feel more rested come Monday morning. </p>
<p>Daylight Savings Time officially ends at 2 AM on November 6th. This means we'll turn the clocks back one hour. ""Falling back"" seems great, but even a seemingly small one-hour shift can affect sleep for up to a week. The time change disrupts the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, and people may experience trouble falling asleep and increased nighttime awakenings. Dr. Yvonne Harrison of Liverpool John Moores University in England <a href=""http://www.smrv-journal.com/article/S1087-0792(12)00114-1/abstract"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">concluded</a> that short sleepers (those who log under 7.5 hours a night) and early risers have the most trouble adjusting to the new schedule. This is because 7 AM becomes 6 AM, which feels even earlier for early birds. </p>
<p>Not only are the mornings different, but so are the nights. The days become shorter and it starts to get dark out by 5 PM. When it comes to sleep, light is very important. Your body's internal clock is dictated by light. You're wired to feel sleepier when it's dark and feel alert when it's light out. When it's dark out, your body starts to produce melatonin, which is associated with the onset of sleep. When it gets dark while you're still at work, you may start to feel sluggish due to melatonin production. Sunlight, in particular, is very important in the getting a good night's sleep. Vitamin D is crucial for serotonin production, and serotonin is involved with many functions of our sleep-wake cycles. Our main source of vitamin D is sunlight, which is in shorter supply during the fall and winter months. <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201105/sunlight-sugar-and-serotonin"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Research</a> has also shown that lack of sunlight can increase feelings of depression and fatigue. In serious cases, the darker days and colder weather could cause Seasonal Affective Disorder, which has been linked to reduced sleep efficiency and less slow-wave sleep. In order to boost mood, try to get as much sunlight as possible. Take a 15-minute break in the afternoon and go for a walk outside. If you can't leave your desk, try sitting by a window. Studies have shown that sitting by the window increases productivity.</p>
<p>The time change may make you feel tired, but it isn't all bad for sleep. In fact, the end of daylight savings is the seasonal signifier that colder weather is on the horizon. Cooler air actually helps you sleep better. On those chilly autumn nights, you'll probably be more comfortable in bed than on those hot and humid summer nights. Sleep experts say that cooler temperatures promote the body's natural deep sleep process. </p>
<p>Although DST impacts sleep, the effects are not permanent. The good thing about our bodies is that they learn to adjust. However, if you'd like the speed up the adjustment process, you can try these tips. </p>
<p>1. Go to sleep a little earlier a few days leading up to the clock change </p>
<p>2. Use the <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/stay-woke-the-eight-smart-alarm-explained-1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Eight Smart Alarm</a> to wake you up at your lightest stage of sleep, so you don't feel groggy</p>
<p>3. Maximize deep sleep by creating a quiet and relaxing bedroom environment </p>
<p>4. Exercise in the morning to get in the habit of waking up and working out</p>
<p>When the clocks fall back this weekend, you have the opportunity to reboot your sleep cycle. Think of it as a clean start. In order to get the best night's sleep, you need to stick to a consistent sleep-wake schedule. If your previous schedule was all over the place, this is your time to make a change and get the sleep you need (and deserve).   </p>

Sleep Tracking May Uncover More About Your Sleep Than You Think,172698691,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By now, you probably know that sleep tracking allows you to learn about your sleep patterns. You may wonder why you should invest in a sleep tracker when you already know how many hours per night you sleep. In reality, sleep tracking reveals a lot more about your sleep than simply telling you how many hours you slept.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A good night’s sleep isn’t just measured by how long you sleep. Sure, you can sleep eight hours, but those eight hours need to be well spent. It’s quality over quantity. There are numerous factors that contribute to a good night, such as the amount of deep sleep you had and the number of toss and turns. In order to see the benefits of deep sleep, you need to spend at least 20% of your night in deep sleep. During this time, your body repairs itself. Your organs detoxicate, your kidneys clean your blood, and your body rebuilds muscle tissues. As for toss and turns, you should aim for less than 7 per night, which signifies you had an non-disruptive and restful slumber.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tracking your sleep can also show you what amount of sleep is necessary each night for you to be well rested. The ideal bedtime is not the same for everyone, but through analyzing data of how long it takes you to fall asleep at certain times, a sleep tracker reveals what time is best for you to retire to bed. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Of course, one of the biggest benefits of sleep trackers is that they can reveal potential sleep issues like sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome after multiple tosses and turns throughout the night are detected. You can seek help from a doctor sooner than you might without sleep tracking. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleep tracking can also reveal whether your sleep position is preventing you from getting a good night’s sleep. You can learn if sleeping on your side is actually not the best for your rest.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Convinced you sleep better with a cuddle buddy? With sleep tracking, you can discover how sleeping with a partner or furry friend affects your sleep. Data can be tracked for you and a partner using the Eight sleep tracker. You can also learn what room and bed temperature is ideal for your sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleep tracking also shows you how long it takes you to fall asleep each night. If you find that it takes a significant amount of time, you can investigate potential causes such as too much screen time or caffeine before bed. </span></p>
<p>You can uncover the potential source of your morning moodiness as well. Sleep trackers show what stage of sleep you awoke from; if you awoke during a period of deep sleep, you’re more likely to be groggy. Apps like the Eight app feature a smart alarm that connects to your bed technology in the sleep tracker and waking you up during your lightest phase of sleep.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With so much to discover about your sleep, using a sleep tracker is a decision you should sleep on, literally.

Smart Mattress Vs. Standard Mattress,172660035,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Each year brings new types of “smart” technology. Smart means something different for each product, and it can sometimes be confusing to keep track of just what makes the new product so smart. Smart mattresses are without a doubt an improvement from standard mattresses, but what exactly are the differences?</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Standard Mattress</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A standard mattress is what you grew up sleeping on. Standard mattresses can be foam, spring, or a hybrid of both; they contain no technology. A typical mattress is not personalized to your sleep habits and is designed simply as a place to sleep.  A normal mattress offers no way of knowing if and how your sleep changes. If you want to track you sleep on a standard mattress, you either have to cuddle up next to your smartphone or wear an uncomfortable sleep tracking bracelet to bed.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Smart Mattress</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A smart mattress, also known as a smart bed, has technology that tracks your sleep. They offer many benefits that standard mattresses lack. For example, smart mattresses automatically track your sleeping habits every night without you having to charge a device or sleep with another piece of technology. This sleep tracking provides you with the data you need for sleep improvement. Tracking your sleep tells you how many hours of sleep each night is ideal for you. This helps lead to better overall health since the right amount of sleep is crucial to function at the best of our abilities.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Smart mattresses manage aspects of your sleep that standard mattresses cannot. For example, the temperature of your smart mattress can be set so you climb into a warm, cozy bed each night. Want to lower the lights an hour before bed? Smart mattresses can also connect to your other smart devices such as Hue lighting, Nest thermostats, and smart coffeemakers. When connected with an app, your smart mattress can also sense what stage of sleep you are in and wake you up during your lightest stage within a half hour of your alarm. These integrations help lead to a smoother sleep experience overall. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ultimately, the difference between a smart mattress and a standard mattress is the ability of smart mattresses to treat sleep as an experience unique to each individual. Smart mattresses help to improve the quality of your sleep by providing you with nightly data without you having to do a thing besides open an app. Switching to a smart mattress is the smart choice for better sleep.</span></p>

What Is A Smart Mattress?,172643075,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">From cars to phones, the things we use most when we’re awake are being made smarter to help make our lives easier. Considering we spend about a third of our life asleep, it makes sense that our beds should be smarter too. There are a few different types of beds that utilize technology, but what exactly is a smart mattress?</span></p>
<p style=""float: left;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The function of smart mattresses is to essentially to help you sleep better. A smart mattress leverages technology to understand what you need to get your best rest. The first thing a smart mattress does is track your sleep seamlessly, eliminating the need to wear a clunky bracelet to bed or sleep with your phone. All smart mattresses require to track your sleep is for you to rest. Smart beds collect sleep data without you having to do a thing. To access the data, you simply open an app and discover your personal sleep information. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By helping you understand your sleep, smart mattresses will guide you to better sleep and as a consequence improve health.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, not all smart mattresses are the same. Certain mattresses are smarter than others. Some self proclaimed smart mattresses for example only adjust the pressure of the mattress, while other smart mattresses can only raise or lower certain areas of the bed for an adjusted form. Then there are mattresses that do more than that, using real time data to adjust your environment to fit your needs while you are sleeping and make sure nothing interrupts a good REM.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight is the first truly smart mattress that can adjust the temperature of the bed on each side before you even get in bed, detect when you are in light sleep to wake you up, and connect with other smart devices to make life easier for you. Eight’s technology consists of piezo sensors in a cover that goes over your bed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So why should you try a smart mattress? Personalizing sleep is the next big step in sleep improvement. For decades, beds have been made with a “one type fits all” mentality. In reality, we all have different sleep needs. A smart mattress will tell you when your sleep changes for better or worse so you can rest well and awake refreshed. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A true smart mattress approaches sleep as an experience and connects your waking hours with hours spent asleep through technology.  Through viewing this data on an app, you can figure out how certain activities may affect sleep and ultimately sleep smarter. </span></p>",,10/16/2017 13:28,what-is-a-smart-mattress,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/AdobeStock_128050518.jpeg?v=1508174908,,open,open,Uncategorized,"Lifestyle, Product"
Why You Should Be Tracking Your Sleep,172610755,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether you’re a busy parent and/or an overworked college student, chances are you could use a better night’s sleep. Luckily, sleep trackers can help. From improved sleep to better health, there are plenty of reasons you should be tracking your slumber.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the biggest benefits of using a sleep tracker is that it will track your individual patterns to understand your lifestyle and sleep.  You can personalize homes, phones, and clothes, so why not personalize your sleep?  Sleep tracking can show you how to get your best sleep. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The amount of hours needed per night is </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/are-you-wasting-your-life-how-many-hours-of-sleep-we-really-need""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">not the same for everyone</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Tracking your sleep shows you the ideal number of hours you personally need each night. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not sure the cause of your sleep problems? Another advantage of sleep tracking is discovering the reasons behind sleep related issues. Using a sleep tracker lets you skip going to a sleep lab and discover your sleep data in the comfort of your own bed. The data is accurate and readily available. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A further benefit of sleep tracking is that it can lead to positive change. Humans are more likely to change habits when they track them. Writing about your sleep in a sleep journal is time consuming. Luckily, sleep trackers show you your sleep patterns so you can improve your sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tracking your sleep also lets you wake up at the right time. A number of sleep trackers, like the bed technology Eight uses, wake you up with a smart alarm during your lightest period of sleep and within a half hour of when you set your alarm. You avoid waking up groggy and in a bad mood and are instead rested and ready from the very start. This allows you to be more productive throughout the day. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleep trackers can also connect your daytime activities to sleep so you learn what is best for you to get a good night’s rest.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Furthermore, sleep tracking provides you with objective facts. </span><a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11233074_Insomniacs%27_Perception_of_Wake_Instead_of_Sleep""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Research</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> has shown that some people over or underestimate the amount of sleep they actually get a night; this can be harmful to their overall health. </span></p>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tracking your sleep is part of a healthy lifestyle. Start tracking today with </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/eight-sleep-tracker?variant=34186577923""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight’s sleep tracker</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> if you aren’t already!

Are You Tracking Your Sleep?,172545603,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For those unaware of the many benefits, tracking your sleep may not seem important. However, the data received from using a sleep tracker can actually help you discover a lot and lead to better sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Those of us who suffer from not being able to fall or stay asleep can find out possible reasons for this thanks to sleep tracking. Going to sleep and waking up at roughly the same time every day is an essential part of a good night’s sleep.Tracking your sleep may help you realize that you go to sleep and wake up at different times every day.  You can use this information and adjust your schedule to rest better.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tracking your sleep can also tell you how many times you toss and turn during the night. If the number is high every night, you may realize that your mattress is to blame. Mattresses can sag over time and become less comfortable, and a sleep tracker is a great way to discover when it’s time to purchase a new one.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleep tracking goes beyond sleep. Sleep trackers often help people realize how their lifestyle affects their sleep. For example, you can discover how many times you woke up during the night and what percentage of sleep was spent in deep sleep. Using the Eight app connected with Eight’s sleep tracker, you are able to view how your daytime activities like exercise and drinking affect sleep. Sleep tracking can show how your bedtime brandy helps you fall asleep quicker but leads to </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/you-booze-you-don-t-snooze-how-alcohol-affects-your-sleep"">a more disruptive sleep.</a></span></p>

This Is How Sleep Is Related To Breast Cancer,172418627,"<p>There is a ton of evidence out there linking insufficient sleep to poor quality of life. Lack of sleep can have a negative impact on mood, cognition, and brain function. It can also lead to an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and even cancer.</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10549-012-2144-z/fulltext.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">2012 study</a> found women who chronically lacked sleep developed more aggressive breast cancers. For the general public, these findings suggested there may be a link between long term sleep deprivation and the development of more aggressive tumors. To put it simply, not getting enough sleep puts women at a greater risk of the disease. The importance of sleep in breast cancer patients was further supported when researchers from Michigan State University revealed that the sleep-inducing hormone, melatonin, seems to stop the growth of breast cancer tumors. The report, published in the <a href=""http://www.impactjournals.com/Genes&amp;Cancer/index.php?abs=107"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Genes &amp; Cancer</a> journal, found that treating cancer with melatonin significantly decreased the number and size of tumors compared with the control group of tumors that didn't get melatonin. </p>
<p>Getting sufficient sleep is clearly important to live a healthy life, but a <a href=""http://www.nature.com/bjc/journal/v116/n9/full/bjc201785a.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">recent study</a> says getting too much sleep may be tied to worse breast cancer survival odds. According to the British Journal of Cancer, women with breast cancer who sleep at least nine hours were 46% more likely to die from their tumors than patients who got just eight hours of sleep. </p>
<p>Although more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between sleep and mortality and survival rates, sleep-related complaints are extremely common in women with breast cancer. In fact, more than <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21825267"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">60% of women</a> with either metastatic or non-metastatic disease are diagnosed with insomnia. This prevalence exceeds both healthy adults and women with other cancers. </p>
<p>Breast cancer treatments are usually the culprit of these sleep disturbances. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can disrupt sleep-wake cycles and interfere with sleep. A one-year, longitudinal study showed that both subjective and objective measures of sleep got worse with each cycle of chemo in 80% of women with breast cancer. The distressing side effects of radiation and chemo such as nausea, depression, and pain can interfere with the quality of one's sleep. </p>
<p>In order to improve sleep and quality of life in breast cancer patients, experts recommend behavioral interventions and alternative therapies. Yoga, light exercise, meditation, and structured cognitive behavioral therapy have all been effective in improving overall well-being in breast cancer survivors. </p>",,10/2/2017 17:06,this-is-how-sleep-is-related-to-breast-cancer,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/Screen_Shot_2017-10-02_at_5.57.16_PM.png?v=1506981457,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
How Sleep Tracking Can Help You Live Longer,172314499,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether it’s to meet our great grandchildren or live to see the first mission to Mars, we all want to live long lives. Staying healthy is key to a long life. It’s no secret that good sleep habits help us achieve good health, and sleep tracking can be a useful tool to living a longer life. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are three major types of sleep trackers: ones you wear on your wrist, phone apps, and sleep trackers that you put in the bed. Tracking sleep using a device worn on your wrist can be annoying; no one wants to have to charge </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">another </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">device. The sleep tracking phone apps require you to sleep with your phone, and that is neither comfortable nor safe.  Luckily, sleep trackers that are built into the mattress cover on your bed are safe and easy to use. Bed sleep trackers use advanced bed technology to monitor your health, both asleep and awake. </span></p>
<p>Sleep tracking features allow you to view a number of factors that are important for health. You can discover your time slept, how much you tossed and turned during the night, your respiratory and heart rate, your sleep schedule, and sleep stages. If you find that your respiratory and/or heart rate is abnormally high or low for example, you can talk to your doctor right away. Without nightly sleep tracking, you may not realize unhealthy changes in your body as quickly.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lack of sleep has been associated with obesity and clinical depression, two things that can literally kill you. When we are able to track our sleep, we stand a greater chance of avoiding certain health risks. You’ve heard the saying “knowledge is power”, but in this case knowledge is better health. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">An essential part of a healthy, long life is a lack of stress. </span><a href=""https://heartmdinstitute.com/stress-relief/what-stress-can-do-to-your-body/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Chronic stress can lead to heart disease</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> which can ultimately lead to a young death. Stress is an inevitable part of life, but it can managed using meditation such as the meditation sessions on the Eight app. Meditation can help you relax and release stress before bed, leading to a restful sleep and a longer life. </span></p>

What The End Of Summer Means For Our Sleep,171812419,"<p>For most of us, Labor Day Weekend marks the end of summer. It's when Starbucks starts selling Pumpkin Spice Lattes and sweater weather falls upon us. Although we're sad to see summer come to a close, our sleep could get a lot better. </p>
<p>Humidity and heat during the summertime makes it harder to get a good night's sleep. People toss and turn more and often have trouble falling asleep due to warmer bedroom temperatures. In the fall, nights are a lot cooler and bedroom temperatures become much more comfortable. Scientists say<span> that cooler air supports the body’s natural deep sleep process. The ideal room temperature for rest is between 60-70 degrees, depending on personal preference, body temperature, and bedding</span><span>. </span></p>
<p>The new season also means shorter days. As it starts to get darker earlier, we may feel more tired. When the sun sets, our bodies begin producing melatonin - the sleep inducing hormone. Leaving work when it's dark outside makes people sleepier, and much more likely to go home to their beds instead of staying out late at a rooftop bar. </p>
<p>As the leaves change, so do our sleep habits. Longer nights and snuggle weather make us naturally crave sleep. There's nothing cozier than sleeping under warm blankets or on <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/pages/features"">heated beds</a>. The fall also means heartier meals like chili, potatoes, stews, pumpkins, and root vegetables. These carbohydrate-dense foods allow us to nod off quicker. However, feeling sleepier is not necessarily a good thing. Gloomier weather and less sunlight causes increased fatigue and lower energy levels. In order to combat this, people need to get their blood pumping. Staying active through exercise is the best way to help transition the body from summer to fall.</p>
<p>Sunny days, which are prevalent in the summer, actually help you fall asleep at night. Although the days are shorter in the fall, you should still make an effort to expose yourself to sunlight. Go for a morning walk, keep the blinds open, and sit by the window at work. Light activates the wake part of the sleep-wake cycle. Morning light helps to regulate your circadian rhythm and keep on track. When daylight savings ends on November 5th, make sure to get as much sunlight as possible during the following days. This will help your body adjust to the shorter days. </p>",,8/31/2017 11:29,what-the-end-of-summer-means-for-our-sleep,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-622220834.jpg?v=1504194468,,open,open,Uncategorized,"Lifestyle, Trending"
How Long Does It Take To Get Used To A New Mattress?,171676611,"<p><strong>BY: Chris Young, <a href=""getbestmattress.com"">getbestmattress.com</a></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A mattress is never meant to last, no matter how much we love and feel comfortable with it. Over time, it starts to depreciate as the weight of your body becomes too much for it to carry. Usually, indentations become permanent, causing the mattress to break down even faster. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Purchasing a new mattress can be an exciting time, and many people fall in love with their mattresses right away, but it can also be a time of some trepidation. Difficulties can present themselves when you’re trying to get comfortable with something that is new. You may think that the mattress doesn’t exactly conform to your body. It may take a while before you become comfortable and acquainted with your new mattress. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this case, there are several things that you might want to review when trying to break in your new mattress. </span></p>
<br>
<h2><b><i>WHAT TO EXPECT FROM A NEW MATTRESS.</i></b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(1) It may take some time for your body to become familiar with the new materials that comprise the mattress. Your </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/your-old-mattress-is-ruining-your-sleep""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">old mattress</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> has conformed to your body type, so it might be a while for your body to consider the new mattress to be as comfortable as the old mattress. It can take </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">up to eight weeks</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> for your body to adjust to the new surroundings. Some people are allergic to some types of materials, so it may be wise to check what are the materials that were used to manufacture the mattress.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(2) On occasion, you might be privy to a </span><a href=""http://thechalkboardmag.com/new-mattress-smell-off-gassing""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">smell that comes with the new mattress</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. This is normal after taking off the protective coating that covers it after being sent from the factory. Smells that were at the location where it was being manufactured will become trapped when it is sealed. These smells will stay in side of the packaging until they are released when opened. This doesn’t mean that the mattress is ruined. The smell is not harmful to people. The odors should dissipate over time, allowing the person to use the mattress without the annoying smells.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(3) When you receive the new mattress, you may notice that there are several scuffs, blemishes, or loose threads that are seen. This is normal from the manufacturing of process and doesn’t mean that it is damaged. These small complications are very common and don't change the durability, the comfort, or the validity of the warranty that comes with the mattress.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(4) You may experience the mattress as being too thick or tough because of it being new. Modern mattresses that are created today are manufactured to be thicker than those built in the past. You may notice that your bed is further from the floor than it was before. Your older sheets may not fit, and you may have to purchase others to accommodate the new size. Many times, the headboards and the footboard can be adjusted in order to change the size of the bed to match the new mattress. You can purchase </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/products/all-organic-sheets?variant=34044136067""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">deep-pocket sheets</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to fit your new mattress to make it more comfortable and to match your tastes better.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(5) One thing to remember after purchasing your new mattress is to give it a firm and sturdy support. If you don’t have a strong foundation that supports the mattress, then it will start to sag and degrade causing your warranty to become invalid. </span><a href=""https://getbestmattress.com/best-mattress-size/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">King and queen sized mattresses</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> require that you have a bed frame with a middle support. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">These are but a few things that might happen while trying to incorporate a new mattress into your sleeping regimen. You must keep in mind that several obstacles my present themselves while you become accustomed to the change. Remember that all mattresses that are manufactured in the United States are hand-made and may have several errors that creep into their manufacturing process. You may see possible skipped threads, or errors with the seams, as well as fabric scuffs and other issues. This doesn’t destroy or hinder the performance of the mattress, or devalue the warranty that comes with it. </span></p>
<br>
<h2><b><i>HOW WILL YOU FEEL DURING THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS?</i></b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After inspecting and setting up your new mattress, you are now ready to sleep on it and to see how it will feel for your body. There will be many kinds of differences that you will associate with the new mattress. Here are some of the complications that you might experience while resting on it for the first few nights. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(1) You may find that you are waking up sore from a night’s rest on the new mattress. This is the most common complaint that is made by people. Your body has become to the way that the old mattress has been comforting your body, but in the wrong ways because it is old and needed to be replaced. Now, your body is finally being supported in the correct manner and now it must become familiar with the correct way of resting on a mattress. After some time with resting on the mattress, your body will feel less sore, leaving you with an adequate night of sleep and comfort.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(2) You might expect to find </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/5-surprising-foods-that-will-help-you-sleep""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">falling to sleep difficult</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and distracting but eventually, this will stop as your body becomes more familiar with the nuances of having a new mattress.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(3) You may </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/why-we-toss-and-turn-at-night""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">toss and turn at night</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> as you try to rest.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(4) Waking up in the middle of the night might be an issue as well, but it will subside in several days as you become more accustomed to your bed with a new mattress. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The amount of time that it will take for you to become used to the fact of having a new bed will not take long as your body begins to rest better. It is different for many people and the length of time can vary. It can take a few days for some, and for others, they discover that it takes longer. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the end, you should eventually be able to rest on your new mattress as you finally head off into a good night sleep. It is suggested to try the mattress for at least 30 days in order to truly assess whether it is the best mattress for you.</span></p>",,8/24/2017 11:35,how-long-does-it-take-to-get-used-to-a-new-mattress,eightguestwriter,Guest Writer,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-502969274.jpg?v=1503589701,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
Here's How The Total Solar Eclipse Affected Our Sleep,171530179,"<p>A rare astronomical event occurred on August 21, 2017. It was the first time in nearly 100 years that a solar eclipse was visible in totality from coast to coast in the United States. </p>
<p>A solar eclipse is when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, thereby totally obscuring the sun. As the moon blocks the sunlight, day seems to turn into night. During this time, the sky goes dark, temperature drops and solar energy decreases. </p>
<p>There is a lot of speculation, but not a lot of science on the effect of solar eclipses on sleep - simply due to the fact that there aren't many to study. However, there is plenty of research on lunar cycles and sleep. A report in <a href=""http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(13)00754-9?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982213007549%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Current Biology</a> noted that full moons tend to disrupt sleep. According to the study, people sleep about 20 minutes less and get 30% less deep sleep around the full moon. This is probably due to the reductions in melatonin, a light-sensitive hormone that controls the natural sleep-wake cycle. </p>
<p>Full moons cause the night to be brighter, whereas solar eclipses cause the day to be darker. So how exactly did this phenomenon affect our sleep? </p>

<p>Using the sleep data from over 10,000 people, we studied the night of the August 2017 Great American Solar Eclipse compared to the rest of the summer. We found that Americans had lower quality sleep on the night of August 21st. On average, people went to sleep much later, about 1 hour 23 minutes later to be precise. They also tossed and turned 32% more on the eclipse night compared to the past 90 days. In numerical terms, people tossed and turned 23 times compared to the summer average of 17. We also saw a dip in our user's sleep scores, with the average being 58 compared to 61. One of the most startling differences we noticed was the amount of deep sleep in Wyoming, which was a state in the path of totality. Those in Wyoming got 29% more deep sleep on the night of eclipse. Their sleep score, however, was still lower than the past 90 days. </p>
<p>Based on this data, we can surmise that the daytime darkness, or the hype surrounding the eclipse, had some effect on sleep. Whether it was physical or psychological is something that requires further scientific research. </p>
<p>Although there are no direct physical effects of a solar eclipse on sleep, there are a number of strange things that do happen. For many animals, the onset of darkness signals their nighttime behaviors. Nocturnal animals like owls and bats come out to hunt and birds get confused. During the 2001 solar eclipse over Africa, most birds fell silent as the sun disappeared. Other bizarre observations include a bunch of whales and dolphins surfacing, captive squirrels becoming agitated, butterflies disappearing from the sky, geese not feeding, and chickens huddling together. </p>
<p>A total solar eclipse like this one will not cross continental US from coast to coast again until 2045. By then, who knows what kind of research capabilities we'll have? Here's hoping the effect of solar eclipses on sleep will be studied once more. </p>",,8/18/2017 12:25,heres-how-the-total-solar-eclipse-affected-our-sleep,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/nasaeclipse.jpg?v=1503442243,,open,open,Uncategorized,Trending
What Mercury In Retrograde Means For Your Sleep,171515587,"<p>When Mercury is in retrograde, it moves in the opposite direction of Earth and it appears to be<span> moving backwards in the sky.

How Many Pillows Do You Really Need?,171236291,"<p>Do you sleep with a pile of pillows? Although this looks super cozy, it may not be the best for your sleep. Believe it or not, the number of pillows you sleep on could be the blame for a bad night. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img src=""https://media0.giphy.com/media/eGe59ekUJEll6/giphy.gif"" alt=""""></p>
<p>Even though many of us sleep with 2, 3 or even 4 pillows, the recommended number is just one. A single pillow is all you need to support your head. The whole purpose of a pillow is to keep your neck aligned with your spine. Sleeping on more than one pillow could actually strain your neck.  </p>
<p>One pillow is more than enough to give you a good night's sleep. At Eight, we have the data to prove it. Since our launch, we have tracked over 8 million hours of sleep. We found that people who sleep on one pillow toss and turn the least throughout the night. And people sleeping with more than four pillows have an average sleep score that's 4% higher than sleepers with one pillow.</p>

Sleeping Too Long Could Be Giving You Nightmares,171217347,"<p>According to a new study, sleeping too much could be the cause of your nightmares. </p>
<p>Researchers from the <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-017-1408-7"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">University of Oxford</a> surveyed 846 adults and found that those reporting more than nine hours of sleep a night were 45% more likely to have nightmares than those who slept for a shorter amount of time. Nightmares, just like dreams, occur during our deepest stage of sleep: REM. Longer sleep allows for more late-night REM sleep, which increases the opportunity for those nightmares to occur.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the study also listed higher levels of worry, stress, and paranoia as contributing factors to nightmares. </p>
<p>Nightmares occur for several reasons, but this study is the first to mention longer sleep duration as a cause. The common explanation of nightmares is that negative emotions and anxieties from the day run through your brain at night causing dreams to turn scary.  Eating right before bed - which increases your metabolism and makes the brain more active - as well as medications are other factors linked to nightmares. </p>
<p>As any survey-based study, there are a few caveats. For one, the sample size was not fully representative of the entire population. Those who responded to the survey were most white and female and an average age of 44. Another shortcoming was the fact that this study was based on self-reported data, which isn't always reliable. </p>
<p>In conclusion, the findings indicate that nightmares may not be wholly accountable to negative emotions, PTSD symptoms, and stressful life events. Further research is definitely needed to assess the association between sleep duration and nightmares. </p>

Combatting Sleep Deprivation In The Military,171206659,"<p>Everyone should be getting about 7-9 hours of sleep each night, but for some this number isn't always feasible. Soldiers, in particular, get way less. In the military, there's no such thing as sleeping in and resting. Between rigorous training schedules and long work hours, many soldiers survive on less than five hours of sleep, and under extreme circumstances some may stay awake for days. </p>
<p>Luckily, the U.S. military is beginning to adopt a new attitude on sleep. The Performance Triad is a 2012 initiative that focuses on the three pillars of good health: sleep, activity, and nutrition. Sleep is vital in achieving optimal physical, mental, and emotional health. Inadequate sleep impairs many skills that are essential to a soldier's mission, such as physical performance, alertness, and the ability to perform complex cognitive tasks. In a <a href=""https://fas.org/irp/agency/dod/jason/human.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">report</a> commissioned by the Pentagon's Office of Defense Research and Engineering, the ""most immediate human performance factor in military effectiveness is degradation of performance under stressful conditions, particularly sleep deprivation."" </p>
<p>Sleep deprivation is a deep-rooted part of soldier culture, and progress won't happen over night. One <a href=""http://www.aasmnet.org/articles.aspx?id=3615"">study</a> found that 85% of active military personnel had some type of sleep disorder. Additionally, o<span>ut of the 2 million Americans who've served in combat since September 11, 2001, 54% have insomnia.</span> The RAND corporation also found that 48.5% of service members reported poor sleep quality, qualified as a ""clinically significant sleep disturbance. Sleep deprivation is very damaging, and its effects go beyond the field.</p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p>Soldiers who suffer from insomnia have a greater chance of developing depression, suffering from PTSD, and committing suicide. And recent evidence suggests the increased incidence of sleep disturbances in redeployed military personnel is a predictor of PTSD. An increasing number of soldiers are being diagnosed with sleep problems, most likely due to trauma, anxiety, and the short sleep duration. </p>
<p>The importance of sleep in the military is not an understatement. Performance without sufficient sleep may have devastating consequences. We must pay more attention to soldiers' sleep in order to protect their health both on and off duty. For this reason, we at Eight are giving a special discount to all active and retired military personnel. </p>

The Alarming State Of Sleep For Emergency Responders,171204355,"<p>It's hard to get a decent amount of sleep when your line of work requires so many sleepless nights. Emergency responders like EMTs, Police Officers, and Firefighters could be on the clock when most people are in bed. In fact, they could be working 16 to 24-hour shifts. </p>
<p>In March 2015, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration referenced a <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/tired-ems-workers-prescription-danger-roads-experts/story?id=31876777"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">study</a> in which 50% of EMS workers surveyed suffered from fatigue, and consequently were more likely to be injured on the job, commit medical errors, or perform a safety-compromising behavior. </p>
<p>Sleep deprivation impairs judgement, decreases reaction speed, and reduces memory retention. Additionally, prolonged periods of sleep deprivation magnify these effects and produce cognitive impairment similar to a blood alcohol level of 0.1%, well over the legal limit. Skills that are essential to emergency responders like critical thinking, rapid response, fine motor function, and multi-tasking are all affected by fatigue. </p>
<p>Every year, the amount of emergency calls are increasing, with the projection for 2020 being 36 million calls nationwide. There's a high demand for emergency responders, and not enough time for sleep. </p>
<p>One of the most effective ways to refresh a fatigued worker is to permit (and prioritize) short power naps at work. A nap of just 20-45 minutes is enough to improve alertness and reduce potential errors. EMS workers should be treated just like pilots. NASA's Fatigue Countermeasures Program listed the importance of naps in improving mental alertness. Pilots who were allowed to take a short nap improved their performance by 34% and their alertness by 54%. </p>
<p>Another way to decrease sleep deprivation amongst emergency workers is to limit the number of consecutive shifts an employee can work. Everyone needs to rest, including people who work in a crisis. At Eight, we have designed the very best products for sleep. As a thank you to the people who risks their lives for us everyday, we are giving a special discount to emergency first responders.</p>

Can Lack Of Sleep Actually Make You Fat?,171148419,"<p>Science says yes. </p>
<p>According to new <a href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182195"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">research</a>, sleeping too little correlates with a bigger waistline and a higher BMI. The UK study found that people who slept an average of six hours a night had a larger waist circumference than those who slept nine hours a night. The participants who slept less had waist measurements about 1.2 inches more than those who slept longer. They also had a higher body mass index, as well. </p>
<p>Clearly a good night's sleep is necessary to be in good health. When you don't sleep, you're hurting your body's ability to perform to the best of it's ability. In addition, you might unknowingly be adding a few pounds. There is strong evidence suggesting that sleep deprivation could lead to weight gain. For one, when you're sleep deprived, you have poorer decision making skills and less self control, resulting in bad food choices. Another reason is that lack of sleep disrupts hormones that regulate appetite, which can induce hunger and trigger unhealthy nighttime cravings. </p>
<p>This study builds on existing research that shows the impact of insufficient sleep on our bodies. And the consequences come down to the numbers. Just as you can change your diet, you need to change you sleep habits in order to be healthy. Sleeping is the easiest way to avoid excess weight, so do more of it. </p>",,7/31/2017 14:30,can-lack-of-sleep-actually-make-you-fat,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-153539010.jpg?v=1501532792,,open,open,Uncategorized,Trending
Understanding The Two-Process Model Of Sleep Regulation,171051139,"<p>Sleep may seem as simple as closing your eyes, but there is a lot that goes on behind those eyelids. The sleep-wake cycle is regulated by two separate biological mechanisms: sleep-wake homeostasis and circadian rhythm. This two-process model was first posited by the Swiss sleep researcher Alexander Borbély in the early 1980s. </p>
<p>1. <strong>Sleep-wake Homeostasis</strong>, or Process S, is the accumulation of sleep-inducing substances in the brain. It's an internal biochemical system that operates like a timer, generating homeostatic sleep drive or the need to sleep after a certain amount of time awake. It effectively reminds the body that it needs to sleep - so the longer you've been awake, the stronger your desire for sleep becomes. </p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p>2. <strong>The circadian process</strong>, also known as Process C, is the regulation of the body's internal biological processes and alertness levels. This is what controls the timing of sleep and it coordinates the light-dark cycle of day and night. Your circadian rhythm is what regulates your body's sleep patterns, feeding patterns, core body temperature, brain wave activity, and hormone production over a 24-hour period.</p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p>To break it down simply, <span>the first process causes a </span><em><strong>pressure</strong> </em><span>to fall asleep, whilst the second dictates the</span><em> <strong>daily rhythm</strong></em><span> of sleep.</span></p>
<p>These two processes work together to create a balanced sleep-wake cycle. While you're sleeping, the homeostatic sleep drive rapidly dissipates and circadian-regulated melatonin is produced. By the early morning, melatonin secretion stops and the circadian alerting system begins. This will overcome the existing sleep drive, thus triggering the body to wake up.  </p>
<p>Homeostatic sleep drive typically increases throughout the day, which is why you get tired as the day goes on. However, it is countered and moderated by the circadian drive for arousal, at least until the night when the circadian clock begins producing melatonin again. When this happens, the ""sleep gate"" opens and the urge to sleep increases significantly. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" src=""//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/sleep-homeostasis_grande.gif?v=1501014680"" style=""float: none;""></p>

<p>Getting a good night's sleep depends on these two processes working seamlessly together.  If these two processes aren't aligned, you won’t be able to sleep well, no matter how tired you feel. Climbing into bed before Process S says you're ready will guarantee a night of tossing and turning. Listen to your body and you'll sleep soundly! </p>
<p>Even though this model dominates the scientific understanding of sleep regulation, external factors such as work schedules, genetics, food, stress, and exercise also influence sleep times. </p>",,7/25/2017 16:11,understanding-the-two-process-model-of-sleep-regulation,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-497066042_1.jpg?v=1501018643,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
This Is Why It's So Hard To Wake Up On Rainy Days,171020355,"<p>There's nothing worse than waking up on a gloomy day. It's dark, rainy, and hardly conducive for going to work. </p>
<p>The reason for your morning struggle is, in fact, the weather. Our bodies rely on sunlight to signal our internal clocks that it's time to wake up. Without bright morning sunlight to kickstart our day, we'll feel lethargic and down. It's not the rain per se making us want to stay in bed and snuggle under the covers, but the lack of light we're reacting to. </p>
<p>Light inhibits the secretion of melatonin, the hormone that makes us sleepy. When there are overcast skies, our bodies will continue producing melatonin, even after our alarm clocks go off. Serotonin, which enhances mood, is also produced in the presence of sunlight. When there is less sunlight, serotonin production is reduced. </p>
<p>There are other non-hormonal reasons why we're extra tired on rainy days. For one, the earthy smell of rain is soothing. The musky scent is produced when a substance called geosmin interacts with plant oils present in the soil. The oils are secreted during dry periods to prevent the seeds from germination. Another relaxing smell is that of ozone, which appears after a thunderstorm. Ozone is a molecule made of three oxygen atoms, and is generated when lightening interacts with the air. This aroma resembles that of freshly laundered sheets, which can induce sleep. </p>
<p>Rain sounds are also quite comforting. The rhythmic pitter-patter of rainfall is considered ""pink noise,"" which is a category of relaxing background noise. Pink noise has been shown to improve the quality of sleep by muffling out outside noises and decreasing brain activity. </p>
<p>Rain definitely makes it harder to wake up, but it doesn't have to keep you sleepy all day. Try eating a healthy breakfast to energize you or hit the gym, if you can. Another way to combat the negative effects of rainy mornings is to open the blinds and give your home as much exposure as possible to natural light.

The Strange Reason Why You Sleep Less As You Get Older,170985923,"<p>As you get older, you need less sleep - and there's an evolutionary reason for this. </p>
<p>New research published in the <a href=""http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/284/1858/20170967"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Proceedings of the Royals Society B</a>, suggests that our sleep patterns reflect the hunter-gatherer behavior of our ancestors. The idea, known as the ""sentinel hypothesis,"" is that in dangerous situations, a group of people (or animals) only goes to sleep if sentinels (watchdogs) take turns staying awake and vigilant. Therefore, the occurrence of nighttime awakenings is the product of survivability. The sentinel hypothesis was first thought of by psychologist Frederick Snyder back in 1966. It had never been confirmed as applicable to humans, until now. </p>
<p>In the current study, researchers examined the sleep patterns of the Hadza people of Tanzania, who still live the hunter-gatherer lifestyle. They found that during a period of over 200 hours, all members of the tribe were only asleep at the same time for a short 18 minutes. They researchers also determined that variation in chronotype -- defined as the individual propensity to sleep at a particular time during a 24-hour period - was driven by age. The younger Hazda people were more likely to be night ""owls"" while the elders were often the ""larks,"" or the early risers.</p>
<p>The sleep patterns that we have today have been inherited by our ancestors. Younger kids stay out late while older people generally go to bed early. “Researchers have theorized that one of the reasons grandparents live so long past their reproductive years is that their function is to take care of grandchildren,” explains co-author <a href=""https://www.utoronto.ca/news/why-your-teen-stays-late-you-sleep-poorly-new-research-confirms-sentinel-theory"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">David Samson</a>. “Our hypothesis is that their lark behavior and shorter sleep times serve a function: the elders serve as sentinels at the times of day when others are sleeping. Therefore, it’s important to have people of all ages in any population.”</p>
<p>Perhaps your grandparents find themselves sleeping less because they're just ""wakeful elders"" carrying out out their evolutionary duty to protect. This is definitely a fascinating theory, and it could potentially explain the poorer sleep patterns of older people. </p>",,7/21/2017 17:35,the-strange-reason-why-you-sleep-less-as-you-get-older,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-521698187.jpg?v=1500674430,,open,open,Uncategorized,Trending
Positive Sleeping: Study Shows Lack of Sleep Affects Your Positive Thinking,170896067,"<p>Those who are sleep-deprived struggle to keep a positive attitude, according to a new study published in <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10608-017-9859-4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Cognitive Therapy and Research</a>. </p>
<p>Now that's depressing. </p>
<p>""In general, we have a tendency to notice positive stimuli in our environment,"" said lead scientists <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/07/170717120048.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Dr. Ivan Vargas</a>. ""We tend to focus on positive things more than anything else, but now we're seeing that sleep deprivation may reverse that bias.""</p>
<p>We already know that sleep deprivation can increase your risk in developing heart disease, diabetes, and Altzheimer's. But now this new research is indicating that it can also impact our happiness.  </p>
<p>In the study, the team separated 40 healthy adult volunteers into two groups: one that stayed awake for 28 hours and another that slept for a full 8 hours. They were then asked to identify happy, sad or neutral faces. Those who were sleep deprived were far less likely to focus on the smiling faces. </p>
<p>This makes sense because there is a link between insomnia and depression. People who suffer from insomnia are three times more likely to report thoughts of suicide and at least <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181883/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">three-quarters</a> of clinically depressed people struggle with sleep. Furthermore, sleep disturbances increase the likelihood of non-depressed people becoming depressed. </p>
<p>Sleep deprivation is a growing problem in the US. In fact, the CDC recognized insufficient sleep as a ""<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/features/dssleep/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">public health </a><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/features/dssleep/"">epidemic</a>,"" with an estimated 50 to 70 million adults suffering from sleep or wakefulness disorders. </p>
<p>In order to be healthy and happy, you need to get enough sleep. A good night's sleep could save someone's life. </p>",,7/19/2017 13:56,study-shows-lack-of-sleep-affects-your-positive-thinking,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-510631156.jpg?v=1500487161,,open,open,Uncategorized,Trending
This Is Why You Should Be Sleeping Naked,170841795,"<p>Sleeping naked has tons of health benefits, but only 8% of Americans sleep sans clothes. Most people don't know that sleeping naked is good for you. We're here to let you in on a <em>dirty little secret</em>: There are actual scientific reasons why sleeping naked is better for you.</p>
<p>1. Your sleep will improve</p>
<p>Your body temperature naturally declines as part of your circadian rhythm, and wearing pajamas could disrupt this natural drop in temperature, which then could disrupt your body's sleep cycle. Being too hot can also lead to restlessness and insomnia.</p>
<p>2. It's good for your lady parts</p>
<p>Underwear can be a breeding ground for infection-causing bacteria. Ditching the underwear will allow your vagina to air out and stay clean and healthy. </p>
<p>3. Your skin and hair will grow</p>
<p>Being too warm at night disrupts the release of melatonin and growth hormone - the two main anti-aging hormones. Wearing your birthday suit to bed helps you cool down, and as your body temperature drops, growth hormone is released and works it's magic. </p>
<p>4. You'll eat better</p>
<p>The stress hormone cortisol decreases while you sleep. However, if your sleep is interrupted from tossing and turning due to uncomfortable pajamas or overheating, your body will produce more cortisol than usual. Excess cortisol is known to intensify your appetite: hello stress eating! </p>
<p>5. It burns calories</p>
<p>Sleeping naked may help you lose weight. Apparently keeping yourself cool while you sleep speeds the body's metabolism. Your body also creates more brown fat to keep you warm, and brown fat produces heat by burning calories. Aside from burning calories, sleeping in the buff can make you buff, thanks to the release of the muscle-building human growth hormone. </p>
<p>6. It builds confidence</p>
<p>Stripping it down makes you more comfortable in your own skin. As you get more comfortable with your body, your self-esteem and confidence increase. </p>
<p>7. Two words: More Sex </p>
<p>Skin to skin contact helps increase the feel-good chemicals in your body, like oxytocin. You'll feel closer to your partner and more often in the mood for sex. Naked spooning encourages sex and leads to happier relationships! </p>
<p>We realize that sleeping in the nude isn't for everyone so If you are Team PJs, opt for something light and airy to keep you cool. </p>",,7/17/2017 18:59,this-is-why-you-should-be-sleeping-naked,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-484959716.jpg?v=1500332549,,open,open,Uncategorized,Culture
8 Reasons Your College Bed Is The Worst,170770307,"<p>College beds are notoriously uncomfortable.

Why College Students Need A Major Wake Up Call About Sleep,170769539,"<p>Sleep has a huge impact on learning, and not getting enough can negatively affect memory, cognition, and motivation. While you're sleeping, the brain is hard at work reactivating and reorganizing recently learned material, which helps improve memory and boost performance. This is why you need a good night's sleep before a big test. Unfortunately, most college students do the exact opposite. </p>
<p>Staying up late to cram for an exam is not doing any good. A <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-03171-4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">recent study</a>, published in the journal of Scientific Report, says college students who did not go to bed or wake up at consistent times every day were more likely to have lower grades. Irregular sleep and wake patterns are common amongst universities. In fact, most students have the worst sleep schedules. They'll stay up 'til 4 AM on a Wednesday, wake up at noon on Thursday, and then wake up for their 8 AM chem lab on Friday. Going to sleep and waking up at different times everyday messes up your circadian cycle in that it delays the rhythms by almost three hours, on average. This means that if the student has an 8 AM class, it would actually be happening at 5 AM, biological time. The research found that throwing your body off like so was associated with poorer academic performance amongst their participants. Another study by the <a href=""http://www.aasmnet.org/articles.aspx?id=4780"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">American Academy of Sleep Medicine</a> concluded that poor sleep habits are a strong predictor of academic problems like dropping classes and bad grades. </p>
<p>Sleep is necessary to thrive both academically and socially. However, <a href=""http://uanews.ua.edu/2014/08/sleepy-students-emphasize-studies-social-activity-to-detriment-of-health-according-to-ua-study/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">60% of the college population gets insufficient sleep</a>. A nationwide study by <a href=""https://jawbone.com/blog/university-students-sleep/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Jawbone</a> saw that students slept less than 7 hours on 46.2% of the nights. Between studying and partying and other extracurriculars, there is a lot to do on campus. Sleep and rest are often low on most students' lists of priorities. This needs to change. There needs to be more awareness about sleep and the implications of sleep deprivation. A healthy, happy, and high-achieving person is a well-rested person. </p>

How To Make Your Sleep Count In Less Time,170768707,"<p>Have you ever wished for more hours in the day? Probably! </p>
<p>Sometimes we have so much to do that sleep feels like it's getting in the way. However, we all know how important sleep is, which is why we can't skip it all together. But, there are ways to make your sleep more efficient. In fact, research shows it's not the number of hours you get that matters the most -- it's the quality of the hours you're getting. This means that you don't need to be confined to those 8 hours. You just need enough sleep to give your body a chance to recover, recharge, and refresh. </p>
<p>There is a simple method you can follow to ""hack"" your sleep. Just like you can train your way to a better body, you can train your way to better sleep. According to <a href=""http://www.menshealth.co.uk/healthy/more-energy/can-i-train-my-body-to-need-less-sleep"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Jim Horne</a>, sleep neurologist at Loughborough University, almost everyone can cut the amount of sleep they need down to six hours a night by following a few easy steps. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Set your alarm for the same time every morning, no matter what day it is</strong></p>
<p>This means you should be waking up at 7 AM on a Saturday morning. We know it sounds horrible, but waking up at the same time every day will train your circadian rhythm and help you get used to the mornings. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2: For the first week, delay the time you go to bed by 20 minutes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: For the second week, delay it by 40 minutes. </strong></p>
<p>Remember, even though you are going to sleep later, you're still waking up at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: For the third week, delay it by an hour.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Continue cutting down in 20 minute increments until you are sleeping 6 hours a night.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are plenty of other ways to optimize your sleep that don't involve such strict rules. The first step in understanding what your body needs is tracking your sleep. The Eight Smart Mattress measures all of the important factors regarding sleep, such as hours slept, amount of deep and light sleep, number of toss and turns, etc. There is even a sleep experiment you can do for 7 consecutive days to learn your exact sleep goal. Once the tracker understands your nighttime behavior, it can set a baseline sleep quality. You may find out that you don't need as much sleep as you thought to feel your best. </p>
<p>You should also treat your bed like a recharging station. The reason you need to sleep is because your body needs the downtime to recharge. After being worked so hard during the day, it needs to rest. If you're trying to be more productive during the day, you must get rid of the temptation to treat your bed like anything other than a resting surface. Spend your waking hours out of bed. Staying in bed all weekend watching movies is going to make it much harder to leave your comfy covers come Monday. As long as you only use your bed for sleep, you'll have an easier time getting out of it in the morning. </p>
<p>Another way to thrive on less sleep is exercising early in the day. For one, it helps you stay consistent and gives you a routine. Working out in the morning also yields deeper sleep at night. People who work out on a treadmill at 7 AM experience deeper sleep cycles and spend 75% more time in the most reparative stages of slumber than those who exercise at later times that day. Getting more deep sleep is what ensures your body gets the chance to rejuvenate. </p>
<p>If you want to make the most out of the sleep you get, the above tips are good places to start. It is a process, but it is possible to maximize your zzz's in a shorter time. </p>",,7/13/2017 10:59,how-to-make-your-sleep-count-in-less-time,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-629189344.jpg?v=1499958560,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
Scientists Have Finally Found The Secret To A Good Night's Sleep,170607875,"<p>Have you ever noticed how easy it is to get out of bed when you have something to look forward to that day? Think about it. . . you seem to wake up so effortlessly before a trip to Italy, even if you have to be at the airport at 6 AM on a Monday. According to a <a href=""https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-07/nu-pil070617.php"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">new study</a>, there is a reason for this. </p>
<p>Scientists from Northwestern Medicine and Rush University Medical Center concluded that one way to guarantee yourself a good night's sleep is to have a purpose in life. In short, have something worth getting out of bed for. </p>
<p>In the first research of its kind, the scientists found that having a purpose in life results in fewer nighttime disturbances and improved sleep quality. They asked participants to rate their life purpose in addition to answering questions about their sleep. Although the participants in the study were elderly, researchers said the findings are likely to apply to the broader public. </p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p><span>""Helping people cultivate a purpose in life could be an effective drug-free strategy to improve sleep quality, particularly for a population that is facing more insomnia,"" said senior author Jason Ong, an associate professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ""Purpose in life is something that can be cultivated and enhanced through mindfulness therapies.""</span></p>
<p><span>The next step in this research would be to find a connection between mindfulness therapies and improved sleep quality. </span></p>
<p><span>What exactly is mindfulness? Well, it is the ability to be fully present, aware of where we are what we're doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what's going on around us. Practicing mindfulness helps reduce stress and cultivates a calmer persona. </span>Being mindful cognitively changes our ability to see ourselves in the world and find a meaningful purpose. </p>
<p>When you practice mindfulness, you will probably get a better night's sleep because it helps clear your head and calm you down. If you aren't aware of the present moment, your mind will get stuck in maladaptive ways of thinking. For example, obsessing over tomorrow's meeting is not conducive for drifting off to sleep. Deep breaths and simple relaxation techniques will help wind you down before bed. You can check out some simple meditation guides <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/mindfulmagazine"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>. </p>
<p>Another way to achieve your life's purpose is to do something you love everyday. Enjoying the little things in life is the first step in finding a happy, meaningful existence. Try dedicating 5 minutes every morning to listening to your favorite song. Or you can do a fun workout. Or you can eat your favorite breakfast.</p>
<p>Being in the proper mindset is imperative to getting a good night's sleep. Once you've found your headspace, you should rest your head on something comfortable, too.
