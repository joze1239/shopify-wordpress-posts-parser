Cinco De Mayo: The Mexican Food Staples That Will Help You Sleep,168591043,"<p>Cinco De Mayo is the day to commemorate the Mexican army‚Äôs victory over the French forces at the Battle of Puebla in 1862. But in America, most people know it as the day to drink discounted margaritas and eat guacamole. But before you dawn a sombrero just yet, consider how these drinks and foods found in classic Mexican dishes like enchiladas and tacos affect your sleep.</p>
<h2>Beans:</h2>
<p>Legumes like the black and pinto beans often found in Mexican dishes can help you get a good night‚Äôs sleep. Why? They have tryptophan in them, an amino acid that gets converted into melatonin, a hormone that regulates our circadian rhythms.</p>
<h2>Guacamole:</h2>
<p>Guac costs extra at Chipotle, but did you know it can help you sleep well? Avocados are high in magnesium, a relaxing mineral that is key in sleep. According to the <a href=""http://www.alaskasleep.com/blog/foods-for-sleep-list-best-worst-foods-getting-sleep"">Alaska Sleep Clinic</a>, ‚ÄúA lack of magnesium can be directly linked to difficulty going and staying asleep. Magnesium is often referred to as <i>the</i> sleep mineral.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Cheese:</h2>
<p>Who doesn‚Äôt love cheese on their tacos? Even my lactose intolerant self endures the stomach pain for the love of cheese on this holiday. Like beans, cheese also contains tryptophan which induces sleep. So go crazy on the extra cheese this Friday.</p>
<h2><strong>What to avoid?</strong></h2>
<h2>Margaritas:</h2>
<p>Everyone knows by now that alcohol can help you fall asleep, but <a href=""https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/how-alcohol-affects-sleep"">multiple studies </a>show that it disrupts sleep. This is the case for all alcohol, not just May margs. Maybe think twice before you have that nightcap, and take those tequila shots well before bedtime.</p>
<p>Most of these staple ingredients in Mexican dishes can actually help you have a better sleep. So happy eating, and happy Cinco de Mayo!</p>",,5/4/2017 12:58,cinco-de-mayo-the-mexican-food-staples-that-will-help-you-sleep,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/guac.jpeg?v=1493918461,,open,open,Uncategorized,"Culture, Trending"
Summertime and Sleep: How The Warmer Season Affects Sleep,168589571,"<p>Your wardrobe isn‚Äôt the only thing that changes with the season; seasonal changes affect your sleep as well. Longer days mean more time for fun in the sun, from backyard barbecues to lazy beach days. But longer days can make it harder for our bodies to fall asleep.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img src=""https://media3.giphy.com/media/A3gcP4hMbyqju/giphy.gif"" alt=""""></p>
<p>A study discussed in <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2013/06/18/to-get-more-sleep-get-more-sunlight/#4a4085b816dc"">Forbes</a> found that people with windows at work got 173% more natural white light than those without office windows. Workers who were exposed to more sun got more sleep on average, 46 minutes more per night.</p>
<p>Sun can help us sleep more, but it can also disrupt our natural body clocks. The sun staying out longer makes us want to stay up later. The increased daylight interferes with our circadian rhythms - our body‚Äôs natural sleep clock. You can‚Äôt dim the sun, but you can <strong>dawn a sleep mask</strong> to block out light and help you fall asleep. Summertime also means more hours of daylight overall, so wearing a sleep mask all night can help block out the early morning sun too.</p>
<p>Changing your body‚Äôs natural sleep cycle each season can make it harder to fall asleep, but going to bed and waking up at roughly the same time year round can help ensure a restful slumber.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img src=""https://media2.giphy.com/media/l2JdTsDKCQSOkJZoA/giphy.gif"" alt=""""></p>
<p>Another summer bummer? Hot nights can make it harder to sleep. <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-people-get-a-really-hot-body-temperature-in-their-sleep"">Body temperature naturally rises</a> just before we are about to wake up, and sleep happens when the body‚Äôs internal temperature drops. ¬†So when our body is hot throughout the night, it makes it hard to sleep well. <strong>Crack the windows for a breeze, or turn on that ceiling fan.</strong> Making sure your sheets are light and breathable can also help you beat the heat. Eight‚Äôs 300 thread count cotton bed sheets are the perfect choice for summer nights. ¬†</p>

"You Booze, You Don‚Äôt Snooze: How Alcohol Affects Your Sleep",168588227,"<p><strong><strong>Ôªø</strong></strong>Many of us who enjoy the occasional glass of wine or other alcohol beverage before bed do so because we think it helps us sleep better (and who doesn‚Äôt love some nighttime Niagara?). It can be tempting to have that nightcap every once in awhile, especially now that it's summertime cocktail season. But how does alcohol really affect our sleep?</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img src=""https://media2.giphy.com/media/E3L5goMMSoAAo/giphy.gif"" alt=""""></p>
<p>It turns out alcohol can make you fall asleep quicker, but overall it leads to a disruptive, restless sleep. ¬†According to <a href=""https://www.chronobiology.com/is-alcohol-disrupting-your-sleep/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Chronobiology</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, ‚Äú...while alcohol can trigger sleep, it prevents the type of high-quality sleep that leaves people feeling rested.‚Äù Chronobiology also states that a study has shown that people who drank a lot before bed fell asleep quickly but had less REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. They also woke up often during the night.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We‚Äôve all heard the saying ‚Äúquality over quantity‚Äù, but this isn‚Äôt exactly true when it comes to sleep. It‚Äôs important to get the right amount of sleep per night,</span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/are-you-wasting-your-life-how-many-hours-of-sleep-we-really-need""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> about 8 hours</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">get a restful, uninterrupted sleep.

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many people swear that red wine particularly makes them sleepy, but while alcohol can trigger sleep, this is not necessarily the case with red wine.

"What Nobody Tells You About Sleep After College, HINT: It gets better",168588163,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">From student debt to future jobs, there is plenty to worry about after college graduation. But amidst all the uncertain chaos is some good news: sleep after graduation will get better.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It‚Äôs no secret that college students often have crazy sleep schedules. From late night parties to all night study sessions, maintaining a healthy sleep schedule can be hard. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the biggest challenges to getting the proper amount of sleep during college is a different schedule daily. From internships starting at 9am one day to psychology¬†lectures starting at noon the next, body clocks are thrown all out of whack in college. Students almost never wake up and go to sleep at the same time every day.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Luckily, most grads will end up with a 9-5 job 5 days a week. While the monotony may not appeal to some, the consistent hours will help set your body‚Äôs natural clock. After waking up at the same time and going to bed at roughly the same time every night, soon it will become natural; you may not even need an alarm. And pretty soon, you'll be waking up at 8 AM on a Sunday </span><span>üò±</span>.¬†</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleeping in one day and getting up early the next can make it harder to wake up, but when you are forced to be up at the same time, waking up becomes easier. It also becomes easier to fall asleep.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So as you‚Äôre nodding off studying for your final final this year, remember that soon your slumber will get better.</span></p>

How To Get A Good Night's Sleep: The 8 Best Rules,168546883,"<p>The consequences of insufficient sleep go beyond next-day drowsiness. Aside from feeling too tired to workout or too out of it to contribute to an important meeting, lack of sleep¬†can also seriously affect your health. It can lead to weight gain, depression, and it may even shrink your brain. Because sleep is so important, we at Eight are dedicated to helping individuals improve their sleep experience. In addition to purchasing a smart bed, there are several other things you can do to help you sleep.</p>
<p>However, we're not going to waste your time by listing the obvious ""no caffeine before bed"" and ""power down your phone before lights-out."" Instead, we're providing new insights and ideas that will make your sleep as restorative as possible.</p>
<p><strong>1. Burn energy </strong></p>
<p>To catch more z's, you may need to spend more time at the gym. If you habitually have trouble falling asleep, exercise may be your natural remedy. A study in the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23946713"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine</em></a> found that older adults who suffered from insomnia were able to sleep 45 to 60 minutes longer per night after exercising for at least 30 minutes three times a week. In addition, exercise triggers an increase in body temperature, and the post-exercise drop in temperature may promote falling asleep. Exercising regularly helps ease stress, anxiety and depression‚Äîall problems that can interfere with getting a restful night‚Äôs sleep.</p>
<p><strong>2. Block your clock¬†</strong></p>
<p>Do you glance at your clock several times a night? Watching the minutes tick by can stress you out and keep you up at night. A clock serves as a wake signal. Seeing the time heightens your arousal level and dampers your ability to fall asleep. Put your clock out of view or flip over your phone so you don't have the urge to look at the time.¬†</p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p><strong>3. Get some sunlight</strong>¬†</p>
<p>Researchers actually found that more natural light exposure during the day resulted in more restful sleep at night. Compared with their colleagues who sat by a window, windowless office workers got 46 fewer minutes of sleep per night.¬†<span>Morning sunlight can also boost your daytime energy and your ability to fall asleep. E</span>xposure to light during the day is one critical way that we affect our sleep-wake cycles. Exposure to light and to darkness drives the circadian system, which in turn helps to regulate sleep-wake cycles over the 24-hour day and night.¬†</p>
<p><strong>4. Stop hitting snooze</strong></p>
<p>You may think that hitting snooze one, two, or five times will help you wake up, but it's actually doing the exact opposite.¬†When you fall back asleep for a few minutes, you may slip into a new sleep cycle. When you wake again, you'll feel groggy due to what researchers call sleep inertia, a transitional state between sleep and wakefulness. This impairs things like alertness, memory, and reaction time.</p>
<p><strong>5. Shoot for the moon¬†</strong></p>
<p>Pay attention to the lunar cycles because the moon may impact your sleep. People have long reported that it's harder to fall asleep or stay asleep during a full moon. <a href=""http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(14)00543-0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>Current Biology</em></a> reported that study participants who slept in a completely dark lab got an average of 20 fewer minutes of sleep per night on the days shortly before or after a full moon. They also showed lower levels of melatonin and 30% less EEG activity, which is associated with deep sleep.¬†</p>
<p><strong>6. Sleep comfortably</strong></p>
<p>Besides sleeping on a comfortable and supportive <a href=""eightsleep.com"">mattress</a>, you should also consider the position you sleep in. If you sleep on your side, make sure to line your nose up with the center of your body. This will prevent that stiff neck in the morning. Try to avoid sleeping on your stomach, because that twists your neck and strains your back.¬†</p>
<p><strong>7.¬†Set your body clock</strong>¬†</p>
<p>Going to sleep and waking up at roughly the same time every day, even on weekends, is important for your sleep. This routine will get your brain and body used to a schedule and will help you sync up with the natural day and night rhythms of the planet. When you go to sleep at the same time every night, your body will start to automatically produce melatonin at that time, and therefore help you nod off more easily.¬†</p>
<p><strong>8. Rethink your drink¬†</strong></p>
<p>Even though that glass of red wine before bed may make you sleepy, it won't help you get a good night's sleep. Alcohol decreases the amount of REM sleep we get, which is vital for memory and concentration. As the alcohol wears off during the second part of the night, sleep is often disrupted, as people frequently wake up. If you're still in search of a ""nightcap"" opt for warm milk or chamomile tea. ¬†</p>

Top 5 Things to Consider When Buying a Mattress,168508547,"<p>When you‚Äôre in the market for a new mattress, there are many things to keep in mind before you put down your credit card.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Support</h2>
<p>Your mattress should offer proper support for your body type. ¬†Does it conform to your body and align your spine correctly? If you feel like you‚Äôre sinking into the mattress too much, the body support may be lacking. Eight‚Äôs four high density foam layers provide the perfect amount of support.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Pressure point relief</h2>
<p>Few of us are fortunate enough to not suffer from any consistent aches and pains. From backs to hips, the right mattress can help alleviate pain on those body parts that tend to ache. Innerspring mattresses tend to spring back with force and put pressure on sensitive areas while high quality foam can offer proper pressure point relief. <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">Eight‚Äôs mattress </a>contours to your body. It provides support to every inch of your body in the right position, thus helping to provide pressure point relief.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Temperature regulation</h2>
<p>It is critical to make sure the materials that make up your mattress are breathable. You want proper air flow throughout your mattress so your body temperature is properly regulated. <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">Eight mattresses</a> are designed so you sleep cool, featuring dynamic cooling. Don‚Äôt pay money for a mattress that causes you to wake up with cold toes or drenched in sweat in the middle of the night.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Freedom of movement and size</h2>
<p>No one wants to feel crowded and cramped in their own bed; you get enough of that on your morning commute to work. Don‚Äôt spend hundreds on a mattress your feet will hang off of. Make sure the mattress you‚Äôre considering offers enough room for you and a partner (if you sleep with one) to move around comfortably in.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Comfort</h2>
<p>Do you like firm or soft? Firm mattresses are generally preferred by people who need complete support and sleep on their backs. Softer mattresses are usually the choice of people with smaller body frames who don‚Äôt need as much support. Eight‚Äôs mattress is a 6/10 on the firmness scale; it is not too firm, but not too soft.</p>
<p>Buying a mattress is a ultimately a personal decision, but these are tips everyone should keep in mind while shopping.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong>Remember: Try before you buy.</strong> Test out the mattress in store to see if it‚Äôs right for your sleeping style. Many online companies offer a trial period where you can return your mattress for free if you don‚Äôt love it. Eight has a 100 night trial period, and you can also test out the mattress for yourself at our showroom in New York.

How Sleep Can Help Shed Those Extra Pesky Pounds,168501955,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">From technology to trends to politics, much has changed in America since the 1940s, including the amount of sleep we get. </span><a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/166553/less-recommended-amount-sleep.aspx""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gallup</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> has been polling people since 1942 to record the average hours of sleep Americans get per night. In 1942, the average hours of sleep per night was 7.9. In their recent 2013 poll, the average was 6.8. That‚Äôs 40% of Americans sleeping less than 7 hours per night.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This overall lack of sleep can not only affect us mentally by putting us in a grouchy morning mood, but it can affect us physically too. A lack of sleep has been shown to cause weight gain. The easiest way to shed those pounds requires no gym membership at all. Research shows that getting enough sleep can actually help you lose weight.</span></p>
<p><b>The proper amount of sleep is </b><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/blogs/news/are-you-wasting-your-life-how-many-hours-of-sleep-we-really-need""><b>about 8 hours</b></a><b> per night.

<h2><b>Stop late night snacking and drinking</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Duh. It doesn‚Äôt take an expert to know that the more time spent sleeping, the less time you are awake to possibly be eating. Midnight munching can be tempting, but if you go to sleep while you‚Äôre still full, you can avoid those calorie packed chocolate snacks and nighttime nachos. </span></p>

<p>¬†</p>
<h2><b>Help you burn more calories</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you‚Äôve had the right amount of sleep, your body is ready to take on the day. You have more energy to go to that morning hot yoga class or on an evening jog that will burn calories. Your body also has more energy to burn the calories you take in during the day faster when you‚Äôre well rested. You may not think so, but our bodies actually burn calories when we sleep too. People who sleep well burn more calories while they sleep than people who get less sleep than them.</span></p>
<h2><b>Increase fat lost</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The less you sleep, the harder it is to drop weight. According to a study </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">published in the </span><a href=""http://annals.org/aim/article/746253/insufficient-sleep-diet-obesity""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Annals of Internal Medicine</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, dieting doesn‚Äôt work well when we‚Äôre sleep deprived. The study found that a lack of sleep reduced fat loss by 55 percent.</span></p>
<h2><b>Help you buy healthier food</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Think about it: when was the last time you were tired and wanted to curl up with a blanket and a bowl of broccoli? When we‚Äôre sleep deprived, our bodies tend to crave fatty foods. But when we have the proper amount of rest, our brains function better and we can make smart choices about our food purchases.</span></p>
<h2><b>Encourage portion control </b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Too little sleep messes with our brain. When we‚Äôre tired, we don‚Äôt put together balanced, well portioned meals. We also have a tendency to overeat when we‚Äôre tired. ¬†Studies have shown that the pleasure seeking part of our brain tends to have more influence when we‚Äôre tired, so we eat too much of what isn‚Äôt good for us. We can‚Äôt make smart eating decisions when our brains are too tired to function.</span></p>

The Easiest Ways To Clean Your Mattress,168499587,"<p>Most of us are probably aware by now that our beds should only be used for sleeping and love making. In reality, a lot of life happens on the mattress, from beauty rituals, to Wine Wednesdays, to natural bodily functions. And life can be messy.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why we compiled a list of some common mattress stains and how to remove them. For most of these stains (except nail polish), you can start by trying to remove the stain with soap and water. However, that may only weaken the stain. To get rid of stains for good, try these home remedies. ¬†Keep in mind that it‚Äôs always best to treat stains as soon as possible since this increases the likelihood of removing them.</p>
<h1>Nail Polish</h1>
<p>There‚Äôs no doubt that mattresses make some of the most comfortable places to paint your nails. But sooner or later your nail polish is bound to spill, and the smell of nail polish doesn‚Äôt exactly provide a calming aroma for sleep. If the spill seeps into your mattress:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blot it with a paper towel to remove as much as possible.</li>
<li>Using a cotton swab or cotton ball, apply nail polish remover to the stained area.</li>
<li>Use a new paper towel to blot the nail polish remover until it‚Äôs dry.</li>
<li>Pour a little water onto the area with the nail polish remover to get it out.</li>
<li>Add a spoonful of laundry detergent to ensure the smell goes away.</li>
<li>Wipe the area with a wet washcloth or sponge.</li>
<li>Pat it dry.</li>
</ol>
<ol></ol>
<h1>Urine</h1>
<p>Whether it‚Äôs from an untrained puppy, child, or the unfortunate result of a bad nightmare, pee happens. Here‚Äôs how to remove it:</p>
<ol>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">If it‚Äôs a new stain, first blot it up as much as possible with a paper towel.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>To get out the smell or any older stain, mix a couple spoonfuls of laundry detergent with warm water.</li>
<li>Using an old washcloth or paper towel, apply the mixture to the stain.</li>
<li>Using a new cloth, ¬†blot the area dry.</li>
<li>To eliminate the smell, put baking soda over the whole mattress and leave it out to dry for a day. (If you have nowhere else to sleep for the night, remove the baking soda after a few hours.)</li>
<li>The next day, remove the baking soda using a handheld vacuum or attachment.</li>
<li>If you can, set your mattress up by an open window to allow air to pass through your mattress for a few more hours.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Blood</h1>
<p>For women who menstruate and anyone who has shared a bed with them, blood stains on the bed are always a possibility. It‚Äôs natural, but it‚Äôs also super annoying.</p>
<p>First, try patting the stain with a cold, wet washcloth and then patting it dry. If that doesn‚Äôt remove the blood, and it‚Äôs still a fresh stain:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mix cold water with 2 teaspoons of salt.</li>
<li>Dip a washcloth into your saltwater solution.</li>
<li>Blot it onto the stain.</li>
<li>Blot the area dry so the solution works its way into the stain.</li>
<li>Dip a new washcloth into cold water and wipe away any remaining solution.</li>
<li>¬†Blot the area dry.</li>
</ol>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>If it‚Äôs an older, set-in bloodstain you just noticed:</p>
<ol>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mix 1 tablespoon of meat tenderizer with 2 teaspoons of cold water to make a paste.</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Using your finger, rub the paste into the stain.</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let sit for 1 hour.</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Place a washcloth in cold water and rub off the extra paste.</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pat dry with a new washcloth or towel.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Wine</h1>
<p>Who hasn‚Äôt had a nightcap from the comfort of their own bed? After that second glass, your motor skills aren‚Äôt as sharp as they were, and you may find yourself with a spill on your hands.</p>
<p>Dilute, dilute, dilute! For red wine especially, adding water to the affected area as soon as possible weakens the appearance of the stain. If your stain is fresh,</p>
<ol>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pour a spoonful of Club Soda on the spill and rub it in.</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pour salt on the stain and let it sit as long as possible. The salt absorbs the wet wine.</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Using a vacuum, remove the salt.</li>
</ol>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>If it‚Äôs an older, stubborn spot*,</p>
<ol>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Put on a pair of gloves</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pour some Hydrogen Peroxide on the affected area</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Allow time for dying</li>
</ol>
<p>*This method will remove red wine stains, but it could cause slight discoloration of your mattress.</p>
<h4><strong>Remember: Always make sure to dry the stained area completely to prevent mattress mold and odor.</strong></h4>
<p>If worst comes to worst and these home remedies do not eliminate the stain to your liking, consider hiring a professional stain removal service. It might be well worth the money if the only other option is to get an entirely new mattress. If your mattress is stained beyond repair, it may be time to consider replacing it.

Turn Your Bedroom Into The Perfect Sleep Sanctuary,168369603,"<p>If you struggle with sleepless nights, it may have something to do with your bedroom. Perhaps it's too bright, too cluttered, or too hot. All of these factors make it more difficult to sleep. So dim down the lights and watch the video to learn¬†how to design a sleep-friendly bedroom.¬†</p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p><script src=""//cdn.playbuzz.com/widget/feed.js""></script></p>
<div class=""pb_feed"" data-shares=""false"" data-comments=""false"" data-game-info=""false"" data-item=""e04a55ea-da74-44ae-859d-3e85382897ae"" data-embed-by=""24bd3a4f-148f-43e6-96f5-91e22755ebd6"" data-version=""2""></div>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Creating the perfect sleep environment is actually very easy. Following these simple steps will help you nod off in no time. In order to improve the quality of your sleep, you have to make your bedroom into a sanctuary. It should be a place of rest and relaxation, free of unnecessary distractions.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Clean up</strong>¬†</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Wickwire-Emerson/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Dr. Emerson Wickwire</a>, assistant professor of psychiatry and medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, says ""physical clutter causes mental clutter, which activates the brain and negatively impacts sleep."" Even if you're naturally a messy person, you can start by putting that pile of dirty clothes into the hamper. Clearing some of the clutter will help ease your mind.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose calming colors</strong></p>
<p>Your room should make you feel relaxed. Bright wall colors should be avoided in favor of more monochromatic earth tones and calming hues. Bold colors excite the mind and encourage activity, rather than rest, which will keep your brain buzzing instead of sleeping.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Dim the lights¬†</strong></p>
<p>We all know that light disrupts sleep, so minimize any extra light by using darkening curtains and shades. You should also power down your phone at least a half hour before bed. Blue light emitted from electronic devices disturb sleep, so turn your phone off (or at least put it on night mode). This will cue your brain that it's time for bed.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Keep it cool¬†</strong></p>
<p>You¬†should keep your bedroom between 60-67 degrees Fahrenheit for optimal sleeping. Your body temperature decreases when you're about to fall asleep, so keeping the thermostat cool will actually facilitate this. The Eight app tracks your body temperature and the temperature of your room¬†so you'll be able to find the idea temperature for dozing off. You can also cool down the bed with technology like that featured in the most advanced bed in the market: the <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"">Pod</a>.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Reduce noises</strong></p>
<p>The key to getting a good night's sleep is to eliminate noises. Although you may not be able to control the honking cars outside your window or the sound of your dishwasher, you can start by keeping your phone on silent. Vibrations and those notification alerts can interrupt sleep. ¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Replace your mattress¬†</strong></p>
<p>The most important thing is to sleep on something that is comfortable to you. Our mattress was scientifically designed for ultimate comfort. It's got just the right amount of bounce and support to give you your best rest. Buy your new mattress <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/eight-pod-sleep-cool/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>.¬†</p>

"Big City, Tiny Spaces: Why A Mattress In A Box Is Your Best Bet",168363459,"<p>Dear New York City residents (or future residents),</p>
<p>This one's for you.¬†</p>
<p>When¬†I first found out I was moving to New York City, I thought to myself:¬†<em>this is the place where all my dreams will come true</em>. I closed my eyes and pictured my new life. I was frolicking through Central Park¬†with Blair Waldorf's clothes and Carrie Bradshaw's attitude, all to the tune of Taylor Swift's ""Welcome To New York."" Yes, NYC is a true cosmopolitan city (*says with jazz hands). It's lively, trendy, and a city of opportunity. But you know that already.¬†I'm here to talk about the less glamorous part of this place: The apartments.¬†</p>
<p>Living in NYC is fun and all, but the actually living part can be quite difficult. New York City, specifically Manhattan, is known for being one of the most expensive cities to live in. You'll find a 4th floor walk-up studio the size of your closet with no bathroom door, slanted floors, and no amenities all for the extremely low price of $2,300 a month! What a deal. . .NOT! Because NYC is #thedream, we must accept our overpriced closet and sign the lease (hey, at least there's exposed brick).¬†</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.giphy.com/sFcguEBAEilVK.gif"" alt="""" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" width=""409"" height=""229""></p>
<p>Adjusting to your tiny space is easy compared to the actual moving in part.¬†Carrying a heavy queen-sized mattress up four flights of stairs and through a narrow hallway with tight corners is a feat that deserves a gold medal. I can't tell you how many neighbors I've seen trying to shove their furniture through their door. The look of disappointment on their faces as they realize it won't fit and they have to somehow return it. Skip the exhaustion and frustration by purchasing a mattress in a box! At Eight, our <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/collections/our-products"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">smart mattress</a>¬†is compressed, rolled, and put in a 16""x16""x46"" box. That's the size of a golf bag for a reference. Shipping is¬†not only free, but stress-free. Unwrap the mattress and watch as your mattress puffs up in seconds. If only there were couches in a box. . .¬†</p>

The Way You Sleep Says A Lot About Your Personality!,168330883,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We spend ‚Öì of our lives asleep, so why not make the most of it? Sleeping is one of the most important things you can do in a day and it‚Äôs essential for a healthy lifestyle. A good night‚Äôs rest refuels your body, boosts your mood, makes you smarter, and helps you live longer. We at Eight believe that everyone can sleep better so we developed a bed that tells you how. Our incredibly <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/collections/our-products"">comfy mattress</a> is paired with an intelligent sensor cover that measures the quality of your sleep and delivers a daily report. You can learn a lot by studying one‚Äôs sleep. In fact, researchers have found a correlation between sleep position and personality. Even though you‚Äôre unconscious, your sleeping habits speak volumes about your personality.</span></p>
<p>Check out the five major sleeping positions below and see if your personality is a match! Since sleep is so personal, we‚Äôve also given some recommendations on how to best decorate your room based on your personality. If the description sounds like you, head over to¬†<a href=""https://www.craneandcanopy.com/"" target=""_blank"">Crane and Canopy</a> to select the perfect bedding to go on top of your Eight Smart Mattress. They craft luxury bedding to make sure you sleep smart AND chic. ¬†</p>

<h3><strong>The Fetal Position</strong></h3>

<p><a href=""https://giphy.com/gifs/girl-amazing-aww-rtuReiKtOESic"">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>If you sleep in the fetal position, you like to curl up in a ball and snuggle up in your blankets. You‚Äôre a quiet person who needs alone time to recharge. You get overwhelmed easily and love having downtime to sleep away the stress. You‚Äôre the type of person who‚Äôd rather spend Friday night cooped up in bed watching Netflix than going out to a bar. Your bedroom is super cozy with exposed brick and blue and purple accents while your bed is probably overflowing with fluffy pillows and sherpa blankets.</p>
<h3><strong>The Starfish</strong></h3>

<p><strong><a href=""https://giphy.com/gifs/simpsons-homer-simpson-snowfall-9QUhxrq9uRFWU"">via GIPHY</a></strong></p>
<strong> </strong>
<p>If you tend to sleep on your back with your arms and legs sprawled out, you are most likely an extrovert. You are open, sociable, and confident. You‚Äôre a natural-born leader who likes to take charge and dominate the conversation. People are drawn to you because of your charm and charisma. You‚Äôre super outgoing and you love to meet new people. Your bedroom is just as bright as you with warm colors like pink, red, yellow, or peach scattered throughout.</p>
<h3><strong>On Your Side</strong></h3>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong><iframe src=""//giphy.com/embed/SHEcjjdZz1tWU"" width=""480"" height=""251.88118811881188"" frameborder=""0"" class=""giphy-embed"" allowfullscreen=""""></iframe> </strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://giphy.com/gifs/sleeping-SHEcjjdZz1tWU"">via GIPHY</a></strong></p>
<strong> </strong>
<p>¬†People who sleep on their sides are open-minded, accepting, and sensitive. You take time to totally open up, but once you do, you‚Äôre the life of the party. You‚Äôre fun, creative, and energetic. You always have a smile on your face, even when the going gets tough. However, you do tend to overthink things and overreact at times. You have a really chic bedroom with lots of beautiful artwork and perfectly matching colors and pretty patterns. It definitely looks straight out of a catalogue.</p>
<h3><strong>The Soldier</strong></h3>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong><iframe src=""//giphy.com/embed/aeu60CPZd8zw4"" width=""480"" height=""360"" frameborder=""0"" class=""giphy-embed"" allowfullscreen=""""></iframe> </strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://giphy.com/gifs/tired-sleeping-peanuts-aeu60CPZd8zw4"">via GIPHY</a></strong></p>
<p>If you sleep on your back with your arms straight down at your side, you are strong, responsible, and resilient. Like a soldier, you live a very structured lifestyle. You probably go to sleep and wake up at the same time every night. You‚Äôre a perfectionist who puts a lot of pressure on yourself to succeed. You definitely prefer a minimalist design in your bedroom and love having an all-white bed spread.</p>
<h3><strong>The Free Faller</strong></h3>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong><iframe src=""//giphy.com/embed/uMxlQ4Th8jYHu"" width=""480"" height=""250.8"" frameborder=""0"" class=""giphy-embed"" allowfullscreen=""""></iframe> </strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://giphy.com/gifs/tired-sleeping-morning-uMxlQ4Th8jYHu"">via GIPHY</a></strong></p>
<strong> </strong>
<p>Freefall sleepers enjoy resting on their stomach. As the name implies, freefall sleepers are free-spirits. You are independent, adventurous, and spontaneous. You love to travel the world and try new things, especially food. Although you tend to be a risk-taker, you‚Äôre secretly anxious and crave control. Your bedroom is cool and sophisticated, but also unique. When people walk into it, they just know it belongs to you. Greens, blues, and grays are your favorite colors.</p>

Science Says To Have More Sex For Better Sleep,168299971,"<p>Are you looking for an all-natural sleep aid that will ease your stress AND help you fall asleep? Well, we've found it and it's called sex! Pull back the covers and read on:</p>
<p>There's a reason why every sex scene in a movie ends with the couple¬†falling fast asleep. Sex has been proven to promote better sleep, and it all has to do with the hormones produced during intercourse. Sex boosts oxytocin (a hormone that makes you feel connected to your partner) and lowers cortisol (a stress-related hormone). These changes in hormone levels leave your body feeling naturally more relaxed, resulting in a pleasant transition into sleep.</p>
<p><iframe src=""//giphy.com/embed/YsSsOGK6tBdTi"" width=""480"" height=""391.83673469387753"" frameborder=""0"" class=""giphy-embed"" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p><a href=""https://giphy.com/gifs/bed-YsSsOGK6tBdTi"">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>The big snooze especially happens when you reach the Big O. When you have an orgasm, your body releases a cocktail of hormones that help you sleep. Along with sleep-inducing melatonin, o<span>xytocin - aka the love hormone - floods your brain after climax.</span><span>¬†It makes sense that a chemical that contributes to trust¬†</span><span>and intimacy would also encourage drowsiness and calm.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>During an orgasm, the brain also fires feel-good neurotransmitters called endorphins. Low stress levels paired with feelings of intimacy and euphoria¬†have a calming effect on the body, which is the perfect recipe for sleep.¬†</span></p>
<p><span>Sex definitely helps you sleep, but it's affect on men and women differs. For women, estrogen levels are known to increase after intercourse, which enhances a woman's REM cycle for a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18710368"" target=""_blank"">deeper sleep</a>. But don't feel left out, men. After sex, men will release a biochemical known as prolactin, which is directly responsible for feelings of fatigue. No wonder they pass out within minutes!¬†</span></p>
<p>Sex is important for our sleep and vice versa. A good night's rest will do wonders for your sex life. In a study published in <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12858/pdf"" target=""_blank"">The Journal of Sexual Medicine</a>, women in romantic relationships reported higher levels of sexual desire and had a 14% increase in the likelihood of sexual activity the next day. Women with longer average sleep duration also reported greater vaginal lubrication during sex than those with shorter average sleep.¬†</p>
<p>Clearly sleep and sex are related. They both are important to our overall health and happiness. Get a little frisky tonight and see your sleep (and mood) improve greatly!¬†</p>",,4/25/2017 18:40,sex-before-bed-is-worth-it,eightcarliedobkin,Carlie Dobkin,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/GettyImages-499596112.jpg?v=1493249266,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle
Top 4 Reasons To Skip the Mattress Store And Order Online,168286467,"<p>From groceries to clothes to dates, we can pretty much order everything online these days. We at Eight even conveniently ship your mattress to you in a box. Here are the top 4 reasons to skip the mattress store and order your mattress online:</p>
<h2>#1 ¬†It saves time</h2>
<p>Spending a weekend hopping from mattress store to mattress store trying to find the best deal is exhausting and time consuming. Days off are for family, friends, and fun; they‚Äôre not for getting aggressively marketed to by a man with a bad mustache in a crowded store. Ordering your mattress online only takes a few minutes. At Eight, we‚Äôll help you do all the shopping without having to leave your bed! You can read reviews, learn about the product, chat with a real person, and order your mattress all in the same place on our <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/collections/our-products"">website</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://giphy.com/gifs/aint-nobody-got-time-for-that-gif-kjelbEcB3I33a"">via GIPHY</a></p>
<h2>#2 It‚Äôs easy</h2>
<p>From the comfort of your own worn out bed, you can order a new mattress with a few clicks and a credit card. Can‚Äôt afford to drop a few hundred all at once? We partnered with Affirm to offer <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/pages/financing"">financing</a>. Affirm is an alternative to loans and credit cards that provides interest-free financing on your purchase of Eight products. You can make easy monthly payments over 3 or 6 months.</p>
<h2>#3 You don‚Äôt have to pay for shipping or returns</h2>
<p>At Eight, we offer free shipping and returns. Why pay to get it delivered from the store or struggle trying to haul your mattress home when you can get it delivered for free? After 30 days, we‚Äôll refund your purchase if you don‚Äôt love it. You have up to 100 nights to send us an email requesting a <a href=""https://content.eightsleep.com/support/"">refund</a>. We'll send one of our partner companies to remove the mattress, so you don't have to do a thing!¬†</p>
<h2>#4 You can sleep before you keep</h2>
<p>Of course, one of the perks of buying from a store is that you can lay on a mattress and see if it‚Äôs right for you. But here at Eight, we offer something even better: a 100 night trial. If you‚Äôre not sure if our mattress is right for you, try it out for yourself! If you realize it‚Äôs not for you, return it free of cost.</p>

"This Lighting Color Could Help You Sleep, According To Researchers",168227971,"<p>Scientists from¬†<a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160608154233.htm"" target=""_blank"">Oxford University</a> have researched how different colors of light could affect our ability to sleep.¬†Last year, the team tested green, blue, and violet light on mice. They found that green light produced rapid sleep onset -- between 1 and 3 minutes while blue and violet delayed sleep. When the mice were exposed to violet light, it took them 5-10 minutes to fall asleep. Blue light made them the sleepiest with the onset of sleep taking between 16 and 19 minutes.¬†</p>
<p>The researchers believe this all has to do with a blue light-sensitive pigment called¬†<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952704/"" target=""_blank"">melanopsin</a>. These light-detecting pigments operate in the retina and seem to affect how we react to different kinds of light. There was also a connection between blue light and corticosterone, a stress hormone produced by the adrenal gland the causes arousal and wakefulness. We could therefore predict that blue light will enhance the wake-promoting effects of light by elevating adrenal stress hormones.</p>
<p>An obvious caveat of this study is that mice are nocturnal, but humans are not. So it very well could mean that green is not the magic color for us. Perhaps green light increases wakefulness rather than sleep. If there's one thing we do know for sure, blue light should be avoided at night. Short-wavelength blue light (emitted from the sun, electronic devices, and fluorescent lighting) shifts the circadian clock, alerts the brain, and suppresses melatonin production. This is why you should avoid looking at your phone before bed. For better sleep, consider powering down your devices at least an hour before bed.

His debut book <a href=""http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/540559/the-sleep-solution-by-w-chris-winter-md/9780399583605/"" target=""_blank"">The Sleep Solution: Why Your Sleep Is Broken and How To Fix It</a> was released in April.¬†</p>

Here he answers my questions about sleep and gives some insight¬†into how we can solve our sleep problems.¬†</p>
<p><strong>You're a sleep consultant for a number of professional sports teams and have studied how sleep affects athletic performance. Can you shed some light on this?</strong></p>
<p><em>Ôªø</em><em><span>I think it boils down to the fact that professional athletes, like the rest of us, are starting to understand that meticulously exercising and eating the right foods is a largely wasted effort if we are not taking care of our sleep. In that way, sleep to me is the third pillar of good health. Progressive teams looking for an edge are trying to find ways to help their athletes understand more about sleep and get more out of it. That's basically the role I fill. By sleeping better, athletes perform better and generally stay in their leagues longer. Excessive sleepiness can be a silent career killer. We want to avoid that.</span></em></p>
<p><strong>Your new book's title is ""Sleep Solution"". So what are the biggest sleep problems facing people today? And what's the first step in solving some of these problems.¬†</strong></p>
<p><em>ÔªøLack of understanding about sleep and in particular insomnia. Many people have great anxiety about their sleep and struggle when sleep does not work out the way they want to during a particular night. My book is really designed to educate and reduce the anxiety many feel surrounding sleep and their ability to get it.¬†</em></p>
<p><em>The first step is good education about sleep. In this world of the ten second sound bite, it is hard for people to get a complete picture of their sleep.</em></p>
<p><strong>As someone who occasionally has trouble falling asleep, what advice do you have for people with insomnia? Are there any tricks you know (that I haven't already read online)?</strong></p>

Listen to your body...it knows exactly what to do.</em></div>
<div><em>¬†</em></div>
<div><em>Stop worrying about an occasional hesitancy to sleep. Learn to appreciate and enjoy the act of resting. It is highly beneficial. There you are in your bed, awake, but relaxed. No boss is yelling at you. There are no dishes to wash. Think about your upcoming weekend. Think about your celebrity crush. Think about whatever you want...just stop trying to sleep. As soon as we let go of the fear of not sleeping, insomnia has zero power over us. Keep in mind too, resting is not wasted time...it is highly restorative to our body!</em></div>

4/20 and Your 8 Hours,167226819,"<p>It‚Äôs April 20th, and you know what that means: springtime and ganja are in the air. In honor of 4/20 and the U.S. states that have legalized marijuana in some form, we decided to take a look at how weed affects sleep. So throw on some Bob Marley, and let‚Äôs get down to basics.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">First, it‚Äôs important to understand the two main strands of marijuana: indica and sativa. Indica tends to produce more of a body high while sativa is more rejuvenating. Indica induces body relaxation often followed by sleepiness while sativa tends to make you want to paint a mural dedicated to Doritos while breakdancing to Backstreet Boys. Or so I‚Äôve heard.¬†</span></p>

<p><a href=""https://giphy.com/gifs/weed-7O1juRxdHNguQ"">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">In a study conducted by <span style=""color: #0000ff;""><a href=""https://mic.com/articles/137699/here-s-how-smoking-weed-will-affect-your-sleep#.0yi065ITo"" style=""color: #0000ff;"">Mic</a>,</span> most experts concluded that when you smoke indica marijuana before bed, it helps you fall asleep. Indica helps to calm you down so you can fall asleep easily without stress and anxiety keeping you awake.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""color: #000000;"">But does it help you stay asleep?</span></h3>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">There are four stages of sleep. According to Dr. Perry Solomon, chief medical officer at <span style=""color: #0000ff;""><a href=""https://www.hellomd.com/"" style=""color: #0000ff;"">HelloMD</a></span>, smoking before bed extends the duration of stage three, resulting in a more restful sleep. Yet some experts argue that it‚Äôs the fourth stage, REM (rapid eye movement), that matters the most. Marijuana may positively impact your sleep before this stage, but some research suggests it lowers the last stage of sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Becoming dependent on marijuana to help you fall asleep is generally unhealthy. There will inevitably be a time when, for whatever reason, you won‚Äôt be able to smoke before bed. If you have been doing it nightly for a long time, falling asleep without it may be near to impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Overall, it is important to remember that the science in this field is still limited, so we have to take the findings with a grain of salt (and maybe a bag of Doritos). </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><iframe src=""//giphy.com/embed/xfD6mEBfQM3wk"" width=""480"" height=""444.2033898305085"" frameborder=""0"" class=""giphy-embed"" allowfullscreen=""""></iframe> </span></p>
<p><a href=""https://giphy.com/gifs/deal-with-it-high-sunglasses-xfD6mEBfQM3wk"">via GIPHY</a></p>
If you feel you sleep better after smoking and are not dependent on cannabis to sleep, then light it up. But if you find yourself waking up too groggy to function effectively, maybe lay off the bedtime blunt.

"Ding, Dong, Ditch: When To Replace Your Mattress",167220291,"<p>A mattress is a common household item, but buying a new mattress isn‚Äôt exactly like replacing a lightbulb. Buying a new mattress is often costly and requires a lot of research to know which mattress is right for you. So it‚Äôs no wonder many people put it off.</p>
<h2>
<b>How do you know when it‚Äôs</b><b><i> really </i></b><b>time to replace your mattress?</b>
</h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It depends on a number of factors.</span></p>
<h2><b>What kind of mattress do you have?</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to </span><a href=""http://www.sleepcomfortably.org/many-years-keep-mattress/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleep Comfortably</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, when you should replace your mattress depends on what type of mattress it is. </span></p>
<b>
<li>Futon mattress ‚Äì 4-5 years</li>
</b><b>
<li>Innerspring mattress ‚Äì 6-7 years</li>
</b><b>
<li>Memory foam ‚Äì 7-8 years</li>
</b><b>
<li>Latex mattress ‚Äì 8 years</li>
</b><b>
<li>Water bed ‚Äì 8-9 years</li>
</b><b>
<li>Air bed ‚Äì 9-10 years</li>
</b>
<h2><b></b></h2>
<h2><b>How old are you? </b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you‚Äôre middle aged or older, Sleep Comfortably recommends changing your mattress every 5 years. Why? Our bodies change over time, and our beds need to change too. </span></p>
<h2><b>Do you travel a lot? </b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It doesn‚Äôt take a mattress expert to know that the more you use your mattress, the more worn out it gets. So if you travel often, your mattress won‚Äôt need to be replaced as quickly. </span></p>
<h2><b>Do you sleep better on a mattress other than yours? </b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you find you consistently have a better night's sleep when you‚Äôre not sleeping in your own bed, then it‚Äôs probably time for a mattress replacement. </span></p>
<h2><b>Is it uncomfortable to sleep on? </b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mattresses are like commuters. As soon as that creepy guy staring you down while sucking on his thumb starts to make you uncomfortable, you know it‚Äôs time to switch seats. ¬†The same goes with mattresses. As soon as you notice your mattress is making you uncomfortable, it‚Äôs time to get a new one. </span></p>
<h2><b>Do you wake up with aches and pains? </b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">An old mattress can start to sag and cause back pain. If you notice you‚Äôre sleeping poorly and can‚Äôt figure out why, it may be because your mattress is no longer providing proper support. Similarly, if you wake up with aches and pains, then it‚Äôs often a sign you need to replace your mattress.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your mattress helps determine whether or not you are well rested. So knowing when to replace it will ensure your mattress doesn‚Äôt bully you into bad sleep. Ultimately, it‚Äôs a personal decision. If you find your mattress is negatively affecting you before the recommended average lifespan is over, then replace it. Investing in a top quality mattress, like </span><a href=""https://eightsleep.com/collections/our-products""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> mattresses, can help ensure a long mattress life.</span></p>

Out with the Old: How To Throw Away Your Mattress,167219139,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All good things must come to an end. The average mattress life is about 7-10 years</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.

After 7-10 years, mattresses can get worn out and lose their original comfort and support. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When getting rid of your old mattress, the first thing to consider is what shape your mattress is in. </span></p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><b>If it still has some life in it:</b></h4>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Sell</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There‚Äôs no shame in wanting some money back from your old mattress to help finance your new one. Listing your old mattress on sites like Craigslist, OfferUp, or eBay allows you to connect with potential buyers. Alternatively, you can try selling your mattress to a local consignment store.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>OR</b></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Donate</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Places like Habitat for Humanity and Goodwill allow you to drop off your mattress at many locations. At other charities, you can even schedule a pickup. Many homeless shelters and churches accept mattress donations as well. This is a great option that makes you feel good about giving back to your community. You could also donate your old mattress to friends or family who are looking for a mattress for a spare room. </span></p>
<em><em><br></em></em>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><b>If it‚Äôs so worn out that it‚Äôs not even fit for your mean mother- in-law to sleep on: </b></h4>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Hire someone to take it off your hands</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not everyone has a big enough vehicle, strong enough muscles, or enough time to dispose of their old mattress themselves. Luckily, you can pay someone to dispose of it for you. There are many junk removal sites out there like 1-800-GOT-JUNK that provide removal services. Another alternative would be paying someone in your neighborhood to take it to a safe recycling center for you. Post signs near your street to get in contact with people, or simply ask capable neighbors.</span></p>

These numbers are sad considering mattresses are 85-90% recyclable.

Netflix and Sleep?,167217603,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On Tuesday, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings stated he believed sleep to be Netflix‚Äôs biggest </span><a href=""http://www.pcmag.com/news/353112/netflix-our-biggest-competitor-is-sleep""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">competitor. </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">¬†On Monday, the company even tweeted this:</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This makes senses when we think about all those those late night Netflix binges. Personally, ‚ÄúTo watch the next episode or to sleep?‚Äù is a potential title for my autobiography. Of course, we </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">should</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> be getting eight hours, but who can resist the wit of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Parks and Rec</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">‚Äôs Leslie? (K)nope, not me. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The sad truth is, those late Netflix nights negatively impact our sleep which can in turn negatively impact our days. Recently, it was revealed that Netflix users watched half a billion hours of Adam Sandler movies. ¬†</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As </span><a href=""https://www.buzzfeed.com/leticiamiranda/people-watched-500-million-hours-of-adam-sandler-on-netflix?utm_term=.oq2B0O2nM1#.nokBD6y1JY%20""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Buzzfeed </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">puts it, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the equivalent of almost 63 million nights where instead of sleeping, people stayed up all night watching Adam Sandler movies.‚Äù</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When we have those late night Sandler movie marathons, we miss out on valuable sleep. Without the proper amount of sleep, our cognitive functions are impaired the next day. When you are not well rested, you cannot work to your full potential. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not only does watching television late at night make us miss out on sleep, but it can make it harder to fall asleep in the first place. According to </span><a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bright-screens-could-delay-bedtime/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Scientific American</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, luminous screens on tablets, phones, and laptops can ‚Äú...s</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">uppress people's normal nighttime release of melatonin.‚Äù</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> ¬†Melatonin is a hormone that tells your body when it‚Äôs time to sleep.

<p><b>So what can we do?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Obviously, the most effective change would be not looking at electronic screens before bed. But for those of us who need those nightly Netflix binges, there are options to help minimize the effects. ¬†Try switching to blue light; there is a nighttime function on some devices that you can turn on to make the luminous light softer. There are also functions on some devices that switch at nighttime so when you‚Äôre reading you see white text on a black screen. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We‚Äôre in an unhealthy relationship with Netflix, but in order to maintain a healthy relationship with sleep, we need to make some changes. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Billy Madison </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">can wait until the next morning.</span></p>

Are You Wasting Your Life?: How Many Hours of Sleep We Really Need,167214851,"<p>How many hours of sleep do I actually need a night?</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a question people have been wondering forever. The truth is, it depends. There is no one amount that is ideal for everyone per night. People are different, so it makes sense that the amount of sleep each person needs at night will vary. However, most scientists agree that you should get no less than eight hours total. So if you miss an hour or so at night, this must be made up in the form of naps.</p>
<p>If you can get seven hours of sleep a night and have the luxury of an afternoon nap, then go for it. But if you know you will be unable to nap, aim for the full eight hours at night.</p>
<p>Sleeping may feel like a waste of time, but if you don‚Äôt get the right amount of sleep, your time spent awake will be a waste too. You will have less energy to do what you love when awake, and chances are you‚Äôll be too grumpy to enjoy being awake anyways. According to <a href=""http://www.popsci.com/how-many-hours-sleep-do-you-actually-need?src=SOC&amp;dom=fb&amp;con=Quartz#page-3"">Popsci</a>, your cognitive performance suffers when you have a lack of sleep. ¬†Many people think they can function on seven hours of sleep or less. Popsci explains that the problem is most people don‚Äôt <i>realize </i>they‚Äôre sleep deprived. If you missed a few hours of sleep last night, you may not realize how it is impairing your work today.</p>
<p>The reason many people claim they do not get the recommended eight hours a night is that they are too busy and don‚Äôt have time. To this, Matthew Walker, the director of the sleep and neuroimaging lab at the University of California, Berkeley, says, ‚ÄúThe reason you are left with so much to do could likely be because you are only getting five hours of sleep and your cognitive functioning is deficient, so it's taking you forever to do everything.""</p>
<p>So are you wasting your life by sleeping? Sort of, but your life will be wasted even more if you don‚Äôt get the recommended eight hours. Your cognitive functioning will be impaired, and you will end up wasting the time you are awake since you won‚Äôt be fully alert.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs 2017. Take one glance at the news, and you‚Äôll realize now more than ever it is important to be fully functioning and alert when awake. You need to know what‚Äôs going on and be able to appropriately react. This can only happen if you get your eight hours. Take it from us at <a href=""https://eightsleep.com/"">Eight</a> -- we believe in the importance of eight hours so much we made it our name.</p>",,4/20/2017 11:53,are-you-wasting-your-life-how-many-hours-of-sleep-we-really-need,emilybertha,Emily Bertha,publish,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/articles/woman_happy_waking.jpeg?v=1492703619,,open,open,Uncategorized,Lifestyle

<p>Without proper rest, we cannot excel during the day. At Eight, we want you to get the best sleep possible. We give you a sleep score so you can change your sleeping patterns if needed and wake up ready to take on the day.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>The technology in the Eight Smart Mattress and the Eight Sleep Tracker tracks your sleep phases during the night using built in piezo sensors. These sensors detect your heart and respiratory rate. The technology can also detect body movement.</p>
<p>The information picked up by the technology in the bed is transferred to the Hub which processes the data. This data then shows up on the Eight app and your sleep score is calculated based on this information.</p>

<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>The Sleep Score is a measure of overall sleep performance. Your sleep score is out of 100. Each morning, you will get a sleep score from the night before. You can view you sleep score daily, weekly, and monthly.</p>
<p>Your Sleep Score is calculated by using a proprietary algorithm that combines a number of factors about your sleep.</p>
<p>Think of your sleep score as a sort of nightly test, but try not to let the colors give you nightmares of those grade school math tests. You can always improve your sleep score.</p>
<p>The color indicates the level of your Sleep Score. On average, certain sleep factors will produce a certain sleep score.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">Red</span></strong> = OK, but your sleep needs improvement</p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Score range: 50 ‚Äì 66</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Avg time slept: 4hrs 30min</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Avg toss &amp; turns: 52 times</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #ffff00;"">Yellow</span></strong> = Good, but still room for improvement</p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Score range: 67 ‚Äì 83</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Avg time slept: 5hrs 30min</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Avg toss &amp; turns: 23 times</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #6aa84f;"">Green</span></strong> = A+, you‚Äôre well rested</p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Score range: 84 ‚Äì 100</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Avg time slept: 8hrs</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Avg toss &amp; turns: 7 times</li>
</ul>
<p>When your score is in the red zone, it is natural to want to improve your sleep score. But don‚Äôt obsess over it; save that for the next season of Game of Thrones. Look at your sleep score as a benchmark on your sleep. You can use it as a kind of thermometer to know what changes you can make to get your best rest.</p>

Body Thermoregulation in Sleep Nation,167214211,"<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p>When we get into bed, often our minds wander. We may think about the work that needs to get done the next day, or we may reflect more intimately on our lives and wonder if our second grade crush Robbie was actually ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù ¬†However, we tend not to think about the naturally occurring processes that can affect our sleep quality at night.</p>
<h2>What is Thermoregulation?</h2>
<p>Thermoregulation is a natural process that makes sure our bodies stay at a healthy core internal temperature. According to<a href=""http://www.healthline.com/health/thermoregulation#overview1""> Healthline</a>, this normal core temperature is between 98¬∞F (37¬∞C) and 100¬∞F (37.8¬∞C). If your body goes above or below these temperatures, there can be extreme health risks. Luckily, through thermoregulation your body will try to bring you back to a healthy internal temperature.</p>
<h2>So what does this have to do with sleep?</h2>
<p><a href=""https://www.tuck.com/thermoregulation/"">Tuck.com</a> states that body and brain temperature fall during <a href=""http://www.howsleepworks.com/types_nonrem.html"">NREM</a> (non-rapid eye movement) sleep. During REM sleep, the brain temperature increases.</p>
<p>When core body temperature drops, that‚Äôs when sleep usually occurs. Maintaining the right skin temperature is important for a sound sleep. When <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18192289"">skin temperature</a> is slightly raised, it does not affect core body temperature and has been shown to improve sleep quality.</p>
<p>Your bedroom temperature can affect thermoregulation. A bedroom that is too cool or too hot can mess up your sleep and prevent you from reaching deep sleep. Deep sleep is needed to feel well rested, but body thermoregulation is more effective in light sleep.<a href=""https://content.eightsleep.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-09-21-at-4.24.08-PM.png""><img class="" wp-image-12585 alignright"" src=""https://content.eightsleep.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-09-21-at-4.24.08-PM.png"" alt="""" width=""392"" height=""206"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""></a></p>
<p>If you‚Äôre finding that you‚Äôre not well rested, it may be that your bedroom temperature has affected normal processes in your body. On the Eight app, you can see the temperature of your room and bed and make adjustments as needed. For some people, warming up before bed can improve sleep. With Eight‚Äôs warming feature, you can set the warmth individually on each side of the bed to get a better sleep.</p>

Eight vs. Casper: The Ultimate Mattress Battle,167213507,"<p class=""p1"">With so many mattresses out there, how do you know¬†if Eight Smart Mattress is the one for you? Well, we've made it easy for you by giving you an in-depth and honest comparison so you can make a smart decision regarding your sleep! Today we're comparing Eight and Casper.¬†</p>
<h3 class=""p1"" style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Let's Compare</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img src=""//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/EightvsCasper_076303b7-34a9-4d40-851d-b0463409a6ba_1024x1024.png?v=1492713025"" alt=""""></p>
<h3><b>Eight</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Eight Smart Mattress is a one of a kind mattress that combines ultimate comfort with sleep technology. Eight‚Äôs four layers of premium high-density foam provide unparalleled support. The foam is specially designed to offer bounce and comfort while ensuring a cool temperature. What really sets Eight apart from its competitors is the technology. The mattress comes with a smart cover and sleep tracker that measures your sleep and gives you insight on your sleeping habits. By learning about your sleep patterns, you will improve your sleep and wake up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day! In addition, Eight is the only mattress that has a bed warming feature, a smart alarm, and full smart home integration - all controlled and customized from the tip of your finger. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Eight mattress falls at a 6 out of 10 on the firmness scale, which means it‚Äôs not too firm and not too soft. It offers dynamic support and contouring comfort without sacrificing breathability or resilience.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><img src=""//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1354/6123/files/FirmScale_large.png?v=1492635040"" alt="""" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""></span></p>
<h3>
<b>Casper</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">¬†</span>
</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The¬†Casper mattress consists of four layers of foam and falls at a 7 out of 10 on the firmness scale. Although it‚Äôs slightly firmer than the Eight mattress, the foams are fairly soft which create more sinkage, especially in heavier sleepers. Because the material is so soft, Casper has very minimal edge support. If you like to sleep on the edge of the bed, you may feel like you‚Äôre going to roll off the bed. Furthermore, the mattress tends to produce a mild smell upon unboxing, and users have said it takes a few hours to days to completely dissipate.</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<h3><b>Eight has 4 layers of foam and 1 layer of tech</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eight is the only mattress in the market that has smart features. Micro-heating elements embedded in the cover heat things up with a simple tap on the app. The bed warming feature allows you to heat up each side of the bed individually so couples can customize their sleep temperatures. You can turn warming on and off automatically each night by setting your personal schedule. Scientists say sleeping in a cool room is beneficial for your health. With the Eight Smart Mattress, you can set your thermostat low but stay warm and cozy in bed. In addition to the warming feature, Eight also has a smart alarm that wakes you up at your lightest level of sleep and total smart home integration - all controlled and customized from the tip of your finger.</span></p>
